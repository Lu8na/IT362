ChIJ6_3yMNUEdkgRgYFYwtACqqo,"Finally went to Liberty London, and what an amazing store it is. Once you enter the department store, executed in Tudor Revival architecture, you cross the threshold to another world --- one filled with rich sumptuous colours, eclectic interiors of dark oak and teak timbers, 100yo floors recycled from the 19thC Royal Navy ship HMS Impregnable, and flamboyant and theatrical display of goods!

I spent my first visit just walking slowly (and probably blocking shoppers), admiring everything from the way the Christmas ship centrepiece hung from the ceiling, to the way textiles are draped on mannequins, the tableware display, etc.

I'll have to come back another day to actually buy something!",5,1768254416,3 weeks ago,en
ChIJ6_3yMNUEdkgRgYFYwtACqqo,"Really nice shopping day at Liberty. Their Christmas 🎄 decorations are always wonderful. The ship in the centre of the main hall is just fantastic.

Check out The Haberdashery first if you're buying fabric - the quilting cotton is significantly less expensive than the lawn for some clothing and many craft projects. Lots of creative projects to inspire. Beautifully decorated at Christmas, but lots of people enjoying toye visit with you. Lovely visit and even lovelier staff.",5,1765221458,a month ago,en

Really we came because the Cruella movie put us onto this, and were couldn't believe that such a neat looking place actually existed in real life. It's surprisingly extensive, being cozy and open at the same time. Wonderful selection and friendly helpful staff. Items are not going to be inexpensive, and there are some eye popping prices, but there are also many unique and reasonable finds. Free embossing on some items too!",5,1762989582,2 months ago,en
ChIJOe3Zp80adkgRoAPhF-w9lA8,"I’ve been a paying model client at Daniel Galvin for years, but my recent experience showed a worrying lack of professionalism and accountability.

Twice I arrived for confirmed colour appointments only to be told on arrival that my stylist wasn’t available. No one contacted me beforehand either time, despite my specifically requesting this after the first incident.

When I tried to resolve it, I was passed between staff, promised call-backs that never happened, and had to chase four times before the owner’s son finally spoke with me. The explanations I received were contradictory, including being told I’d spoken to someone on the morning of my appointment when I hadn’t.

Instead of taking responsibility, management offered no real solution. Despite both missed appointments being due to their own internal miscommunication, I was told the next model slot would be in January (this was November) or that I could pay full price to fix their mistake. It felt unfair and unprofessional.

I understand that premium clients get priority, but how a salon treats every client  - reveals its values. In this case, follow-through, honesty, and care were all missing.

A salon can’t claim to offer a premium experience when basic communication repeatedly fails. Based on this, I would avoid.",1,1765379769,a month ago,en

ChIJOe3Zp80adkgRoAPhF-w9lA8,"Really pleased with my visit to Daniel Gavin (George Street salon) last week! I was a bit nervous about getting highlights done somewhere new, but Hannah was fantastic - took the time to understand exactly what I wanted and the colour came out perfectly. Not too bold, just really natural-looking highlights that brighten up my hair.

Joleen did my blow dry afterwards and honestly, my hair has never looked better! She really knew what she was doing and it looked amazing all evening.

The salon is lovely - quite busy but in a good way, you can see it's popular. Staff were friendly and I felt looked after throughout.
Definitely going back for my next colour. Would recommend if you're looking for a good colourist in the area.

Thanks Hannah and Joleen!",5,1751357711,7 months ago,en

She took the time to carefully assess my skin, explained everything clearly, and most importantly did not push me into any treatment that wasn’t suitable for my situation.

As my wedding is very close, Sharen honestly advised that certain treatments could increase the risk of pigmentation and recommended not proceeding right now, which I really appreciated. That level of honesty shows real care for the client, not just selling treatments.

She was calm, knowledgeable, reassuring, and answered all my questions properly. I felt listened to and confident in her advice. I will definitely return for treatment later when the timing is right.

ChIJpdxjkneOcUgRPKNIf8RFy64,"Sadly, my experience is the same as many that have reviewed this place. I was brought a spa experience by a friend for Christmas. Trying to book this was a nightmare. Emails took over a week to respond to and with no way of calling and actually speaking to someone. Initially they tried telling me my voucher was out of date...(it wasn't). Once they admitted it was in date (3 weeks in to the process) they proceeded to tell me there were no packages left and I'd have to upgrade to a 'bonus' package. The email exchange was dismissive and at times rude. After agreeing to pay a £19.50 'admin' fee to upgrade I demanded confirmation in writing as something was not sitting right with me. Again, a week on I got confirmation that the fee was per person, which I had not agreed to. I requested they honoured the voucher that had been purchased but all I got back was a short.....I'm sorry, we cannot help you.

I tried to make early bookings in September for December and she still wouldn’t give me any although they were available. After a lengthy email, I was given the booking. When I got there, I was told I had to pay £30 for a facial which I wasn’t made aware of. I was told that if I didn’t pay for it, I wouldn’t receive any treatments. So me and my friend paid in the end. It was like we were literally bullied into it. Then we were asked to go into separate rooms to receive the massage. My friend had a terrible experience!

When I replied saying why was my booking cancelled if my appointment slot was booked and reserved over a week ago, she rudely replied just saying ""It's busy"". No apology or valid explanation. This was a poor reason to cancel my booking last minute and both the woman who booked me in at was Angelsz and the manager who I spoke to just seemed unapologetic and did not seem to care that they had ruined my birthday plans.

The actual price in most London stores is around £17.50, but Boots had increased it to £19.50 and then added a “discount” to make it look like a good deal. This feels dishonest and misleading to customers.
When I raised the issue with the manager, she was extremely unprofessional, rude, and lacked basic customer service knowledge.

One aspect I found particularly helpful was the bicarbonate-soda option, which isn’t commonly available elsewhere.

The guidance I received made it easier for me to adjust my eating habits, and I found myself naturally inclined to make healthier choices in the days that followed.

The consultation wasn’t done in a private room just by the till despite there being a private room that was unoccupied.

It was clear the male pharmacist who spoke to me had a very limited knowledge of the different contraception methods as, instead of guiding me through my different options and the pros and cons like he should have, he told me that I should see my GP for this kind of thing. The extent of his knowledge was telling me what his patients typically go for and that it was ‘good’.

On your website the appointment should have gone as follows: Our pharmacy team will ask you some initial questions and afterwards, you’ll have a consultation with the pharmacist in a private consultation room. They will ask you relevant health-related questions to work out the best way to help you, and you may have your blood pressure checked and your BMI measured by a member of the team. Our pharmacists will offer advice and, where appropriate, make a supply of oral contraception.

ChIJdcXtj9QadkgRUfFL1MptvtY,"I have lupus (SLE) and due to photosensitivity, I have developed quite severe hyperpigmentation on my face. Finding a clinic that truly understood my condition and cared about my safety and confidence was incredibly important to me. From my very first consultation at The Laser Treatment Clinic, I felt completely looked after. The team showed genuine compassion, patience, and understanding. They didn’t rush me or treat me like just another client. They carefully went through all my options and made sure any treatment would be safe and suitable for my skin and health.

After a detailed assessment, I was recommended the Derma White Treatment, an exclusive herbal treatment designed for all skin types. They took the time to explain every detail and what results I could expect. I really appreciated how bespoke the whole process felt. It wasn’t a generic recommendation but something tailored specifically to me and my condition.

I’ve now had four sessions and I’m genuinely seeing amazing results. My hyperpigmentation has improved so much and I finally feel hopeful and more confident in my own skin again. What stood out to me the most was how personal and caring everyone has been throughout my journey. The therapists are so warm and welcoming, always asking how I’m getting on and taking the time to listen to any questions or concerns I have. I always feel comfortable and reassured and I can tell they truly want me to see progress rather than make a quick sale.

The clinic itself is beautiful, spotless, and calming. It’s professional without being cold or intimidating. I felt like I was in expert hands but still treated as a person, not a number. The entire team is lovely and you can tell they genuinely care about their clients’ wellbeing and confidence.

When I started my treatment, they even gave me a complimentary aftercare package and went through it thoroughly with me so I understood exactly how to care for my skin between sessions. This is something I haven’t experienced anywhere else. I’ve been to a few consultations at other clinics before, but none of them made me feel cared for or confident enough to go ahead. The Laser Treatment Clinic completely changed that for me.

It means so much to have found a place that truly understands my lupus and treats me with compassion, professionalism, and personal care. I’m so grateful for the entire team and I’ll definitely be continuing with more of their treatments.

I’d considered an alternative topical treatment cream but had heard mixed reviews about it.
I had a combination treatment of both the Derma White Treatment combined with laser across my cheeks on the suggestion of the aesthetician.

I’d developed what I thought were very cute freckles in my late twenties,, but they developed into quite large pigment spots. I never thought the treatment would be so impactful.
After the  treatment (which involved around 4/5 days of peeling), all the large spots had faded very significantly. The fainter spots had completely disappeared.
I took lots of photos which were very satisfying to look at as they tracked the changes in my skin.
I now have noticeably clearer and brighter skin which is free of the dark hyperpigmentation. And I know it works, so that when they return- back I go!

Due to ongoing mental health conditions, including ADHD and mild autism, I have been unable to attend sessions. These are protected disabilities under the Equality Act 2010, yet I was offered no reasonable adjustments or understanding. Instead, the clinic manager, Modjdeh Sheri, refused to issue a refund and tried to push a so-called ""goodwill gesture"" to transfer my treatment to someone else—which I did not ask for and do not accept.
This approach is unethical, manipulative, and shows a complete lack of care for vulnerable customers. I have now begun legal proceedings to recover the money I am owed. I do not recommend this clinic to anyone—especially those with disabilities or mental health conditions.

To reply to your response which further speaks about a separate treatment that has no relevance to this topic as I won’t be continuing due to the mental health impact this has all had on me. I am speaking strictly about the refund for the £645 for a separate partial treatment package NOT the first treatments I have already stated I won’t be continuing with them and this has NO RELEVANCE.

I am currently seeking legal advice regarding a dispute with this clinic, relating to a laser treatment package I was unable to complete due to mental health conditions, including ADHD and autism.
Despite notifying the clinic of these conditions, they have refused to refund £645 for treatments I did not receive. I was not made aware of their refund or expiry policy at the time of payment, and I did not sign any consent forms or contracts that clearly outlined these terms in relation to disability or medical accommodations.
While the clinic has offered alternative treatments or transfers of the package as a goodwill gesture, I have made it clear that I will not be continuing with the 12-session treatment plan or any other substituted service. My request is for a refund of the amount paid for treatments I could not reasonably attend due to my disability, which I believe is protected under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Equality Act 2010.
If a satisfactory resolution is not reached within 14 days of my most recent written communication, I intend to escalate the matter through Small Claims Court and pursue any relevant claims under disability discrimination legislation.

ChIJnVCT_lkbdkgRZfzq4xmNkSU,"I am writing this review as a warning to potential clients, particularly those seeking a technical colour service like Balayage. My experience with Daniele was deeply unsatisfactory, resulting in technical failure, hair damage.

I booked a Balayage, requesting a subtle, blended, and non-damaging colour transition. The service was a fundamental failure under the professional standard expected of a ""Master Colourist.""

1. Technical Failures and Misrepresentation:
• Result vs. Service: I paid for a Balayage (a smooth, blended, natural gradient), but received a result that was objectively a set of poorly executed Highlights. The result showed harsh, distinct bands of colour with no smooth transition (see attached photos).

• Initial Flaw: The first result was three distinct, unblended colour bands: my natural root, a harsh line of brassy orange, and then yellow. This is a technical error, not a ""different technique.""

• Inadequate Toning: The toner was left on for an insufficient time (approximately 5 minutes), resulting in persistent, unflattering yellow and brassy tones that Daniele later insisted were ""perfect"" and ""how it is meant to be.""

2. Hair Damage and Lack of Care:
• Despite being informed my hair was fragile, Daniele used 6% hydrogen peroxide and left the bleach on my hair for an excessive period of time (over 3 hours in total, with bleach fully saturated for over 50 minutes).

• This overly aggressive and prolonged processing constitutes a clear lack of reasonable care and resulted in my hair being damaged and burnt. When I questioned the process, his only response was to state he was a ""professional.""

3. Poor Customer Service and Refusal to
Rectify:

• After seeing the colour failure in natural light, I immediately returned. Daniele initially tried to dismiss the problem, stating there ""wasn’t much he could do.""

• I was misled about the salon’s closing time, told to come back after 6:00 PM (closing time is at 6pm) for a fix. I then had to wait an additional hour in the salon for him to address the issue.

• The final correction attempt was incomplete. He refused to lift the roots to the requested level or properly tone the ends.

• Refusal of Refund: After spending over 7 hours in the salon for a failed service and a failed fix, he refused a refund, maintaining the colour was ""perfect.""

I paid for a professional Balayage and received a technically faulty, damaging, and unacceptable service with the technique being that used for highlights (confirmed by a professional master colourist).

The salon has refused to provide the full refund that is warranted under my consumer rights for services not delivered with reasonable care and skill.

I strongly advise clients to look elsewhere for quality colour work.

I had hot stone massage and a facial and they were done really well I can't fault the treatment at all. The facilities are small but there was no one else there except me. This is more of a 2/3 hour spa experience - maybe if the advertising reflected that it would get less complaints as facilities are small and you only have a gym, sauna and swimming pool. Slight things the spa could improve on- a nice warm greeting and explanation of where things are and what to do e.g you will have treatments first then use facilities after for an hour- please help yourself to water it is here etc. As it is small it is self explanatory but still it adds a nice touch as I did see other people  look around a bit lost like I did until you realised the plan. The water would give a more luxury feel if they used slices of lemon or cucumber and clear plastic cups rather than white insulated cups you would use in a cheap cafe. Also the resting area above the pool needs to be cleaned from underneath as the lack marks make it feel dirty. I've been to quite a few London spas

Afroditi is the only one person the world who truly knows how to blow-dry my hair properly—it’s thick and not easy to style.

They truly understand my hair and look after it in the most incredible way. What’s especially important to me is that it doesn’t take so much time — I used to dread going to get my hair done, and now I genuinely look forward to it.

ChIJsTOhRjwFdkgR_FdASHvc1uc,"Neville’s Hair & Beauty is, quite simply, the best salon in the world. And I say that as someone who has been to many salons internationally.

I’ve been coming to Neville’s for over 15 years, and there’s a reason I’ve never gone anywhere else. They truly cover every base — from high-fashion, editorial-level hair (they work behind the scenes at fashion shows) to timeless, elegant everyday styling. Whatever you need, they deliver it flawlessly.

Every stylist is top-tier: incredibly skilled, intuitive, and genuinely attentive. They listen, they understand exactly what you want, and they execute with precision and care. The service is always impeccable — warm, professional, and consistent — and they are wonderfully reliable and accommodating when it comes to booking.

Neville’s looks after my mum’s hair, my family’s hair, and my friends’ hair — all with equally beautiful results. There’s a real sense that they care deeply about what they do, and that level of pride shows in the outcome every single time.

Thanks to them, my hair is now healthy, glossy, strong, and glowing again — and I absolutely love it.

I now travel back to London every month just to do my colour and have a proper blow-dry — because no one does it like they do. The technical level, the attention to detail, and the understanding of hair are simply unmatched.
Beyond the results, the team has genuinely become a family. Everyone is inclusive, caring, and goes out of their way to help. This has meant even more to me recently, as living in Dubai and dealing with hard/dirty water caused me to lose almost half of my hair — and they supported me with expertise, honesty, and kindness at every step.
The cherry on top is Elena, the co-owner: Italian, incredibly knowledgeable, and far beyond a hair professional — she is a true luxury consultant who understands beauty, lifestyle, and confidence in a very rare way.

I came to the academy with great enthusiasm, and the team did everything possible to make my learning experience both enjoyable and comfortable. The training was well- structured, supportive, and focused on building strong practical skills and confidence for working in the beauty industry.
From the very beginning, Stella and Amy were incredibly kind, professional, and supportive, always providing clear information and guidance throughout the course.
All the tutors are excellent, but my favourite was Pembe, the Level 2 & 3 tutor. She explains everything clearly, teaches with passion, and prepares her students to feel confident and ready to work after completing the course.

I trained level 2&3 nail technician course, with my lovey and knowledgable tutor Joanna, she was really helpful plenty of one on one time in lessons as the classes are small (if your worried about not getting enough support don’t be!)

At the beginning of the course, the teachers also checked in with us to see how we were adapting, which made the learning environment very supportive and reassuring. The training is well-structured, with a good balance of theory and hands-on practice.

ChIJi-RglM4adkgRTwft1ehMYUY,"I would strongly advise you save your money and  avoid this school.

I enrolled on the VTCT Level 2 & 3 combined course and was taught by a tutor called Pembe. Her behaviour was consistently passive-aggressive, condescending, and unprofessional. Instead of being supportive, she will make you feel small and embarrassed for not immediately understanding things. Good luck if she’s teaching you.

After completing the course end of Aug, I later found out that my VTCT certificates had been ready since October but I was never informed, despite chasing the centre several times. I only discovered this in January, while other students had already been notified.

What makes this especially troubling is that I was the only Black Muslim woman in my class and the only student who experienced this both from the tutor and in the way my certificate was handled. I am not making accusations but it is difficult not to question why one person was left out while everyone else was processed correctly.

When I raised this formally, instead of a proper apology and accountability, I was offered a £100 “goodwill” voucher for a future course. That response alone says a lot about how concerns about fairness and discrimination are handled at this school.

The attitude of the staff in this branch is generally like this anyway, but today when I went to collect my online order, there was one person in front of me in the queue. While one employee was dealing with that person, the queue quickly became five people including myself. Even though there were two other employees inside, they did not help the waiting customers — one was busy with something else, and the other was chatting with someone.

When it was finally my turn, the employee told me to find another staff member inside the store. I told them there was no one, yet they insisted in a rude manner and asked me to check again. When I went to the security guard, he told me there was no staff member inside the store and that I needed to go back to the till section. I explained that I had been sent from there, so he came with me and informed the staff himself that there was indeed no one inside to assist customers. After that, they still made me wait again before completing my order.

I was already annoyed because the order I placed on November 24th, which was supposed to be delivered on November 29th, was delayed by five days. Experiencing this behaviour on top of the delay made me even more frustrated. I really think the staff need to improve their attitude and professionalism.

I recently spent over £100 at the Boots store in Swansea, but was very disappointed with how I was treated when I visited the Paddington branch. One of the items I purchased, worth just £5.59, turned out to be faulty. I opened it on the train and went to Boots Paddington to request a refund.

Instead of receiving help, I was met with over 10 minutes of argument from a staff member in front of my child and other customers. She insisted that they don’t stock that brand and told me I had to find a different Boots branch that did – which is completely unreasonable for a national retailer with shared systems. I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong for returning a faulty product.

Eventually, I asked to speak with a manager. He came over but didn’t acknowledge me at all – no hello, no apology, nothing. He processed the return without saying a word. The lack of basic courtesy or empathy from both staff members was unacceptable.

ChIJ-ep08kIFdkgRO7soL9E7lnA,"We have lived between London and NYC since 2012, visit every continent but Antarctica almost every year, so I’ve had my nails done in Australia, America, Africa, Asia, extensively this year, Italy last month.

I ALWAYS do gel manicures on my hands with chrome, regular polish on my feet, in the closest color to match the chrome hands.

London is always the hardest place in the world to find chrome; it’s easier to find chrome colors in remote Asia or Africa than London.

I’ve gone to the same nail salon near our house in Kensington for years, but they only have basic chrome options, so I’ve been searching for a new salon, and as we were leaving town for over a month, I also wanted to get my nails done so as to not have to hunt down a salon on holiday.

I always do the same two colors in summer, alternating between a rose chrome pink, or a magenta chrome.

My boyfriend called Chelsea salons (we lived in Chelsea prior to moving to Ken), and this place said they have hundreds of all 5 star reviews, and many many chrome colors.

I googled and saw they do NOT have positive reviews, but that doesn’t matter, as long as they have lots of chrome options (there’s no nail salon I’ve encountered in London that’s nearly as nice as my nail salon in Sydney - not to mention free champagne, but Sydney is more sophisticated than London; AND taught me about chrome, years ago).

We go in and I show the magenta chrome picture below, saying this is a color I do often (I always show the same photo for my desired chrome nail color) - do they have this color?

They assured me they did.

They started on my feet and picked out a regular polish for my toes they insisted would be the closest match (ironically an Essie I’ve owned for >10 years).

It’s happened before in London when they say that and it turns out they have nothing and I’m screwed (as they’ve done your toes whatever color they allege is the closest to the photo and then oops they don’t actually have anything similar to the picture in chrome for your hands), so I was already concerned, as by then they’ve put on your pedicure color, so you’re trapped and have to hope they’ll be able to match the chrome as they assured, since unlike every other country on earth, they don’t have specific chrome colors, i.e. most salons around the world paint your nails a white or black base then put the chrome on in whatever color you want, but this place said they’d have to paint my nails pink and then put chrome on to match the photo (ie whoops they don’t actually have the color as they alleged, but I don’t care how they get to the end result as long as they get there).

Turned out they have no different chrome options to my normal salon in Kensington, at a higher cost.

They suggested using their only pink chrome which was similar to the rose chrome I came in with, not like the dark magenta they had painted my toes (also note they refused to put chrome on my regular pedicure; the latest salon in Sicily was the first to suggest doing that and it worked wonderfully, if they’d just done that it could’ve resolved part of the problem, even though I’d have left with the same color I arrived with, and it wasn’t what I asked for).

Not only am I stuck with my first NON chrome manicure in over a year, but also tried to charge the £105 quoted even though I DONT HAVE CHROME, it’s the same gel manicure I always have BEFORE chrome is applied!

I’ll add he never used sealing/cuticle oil (never did my cuticles at all in fact), no lotion on my hands.

I came in with the rose pink chrome color below, asked for the magenta chrome with the plates and rings (third photo), which they ASSURED me they had, and left with the non-chrome final photo below.

The most annoying was they refused to apologise or acknowledge they simply shouldn’t have said they had the colour in the first place if they didn’t have anything close, so if I wanted to use their menial options for chrome, I would, by definition, have toes of a completely different color to my hands.

It shows the negative reviews are probably accurate.",1,1762245698,3 months ago,en

ChIJq5XIW8oEdkgRqmg5RAC_ih8,"We stayed at One Aldwych over New Year’s for several nights and overall had a very pleasant stay, although there are a few details that could be improved.

The hotel has a boutique feel and the location is excellent. The staff were extremely friendly and professional, especially the doorman, who did a great job throughout our stay.

The spa was okay, but nothing particularly special. The pool and spa area felt a bit underwhelming and could benefit from better care, especially around New Year’s. The water station in the spa was out of order and the water canisters were often empty, which was disappointing.

The bar is beautiful and the drinks were very good. Breakfast upstairs in the restaurant was excellent, with a great selection and a very nice ambiance overlooking the lobby. Room service was also good, with a solid menu including classics like fish and chips.

One thing that was genuinely disturbing was being called by housekeeping at around 1:00 pm and again a couple of hours later after New Year’s Eve, despite the “Do Not Disturb” sign being on. The same thing happened again the following day. This should not happen.

Another odd detail was that after adding my partner’s name to the reservation upon arrival, the hotel began addressing me by her last name, and the final invoice was also issued in her name, even though the booking was under mine.

Overall, we had a good stay. The hotel feels more like a high-end business hotel than a holiday destination. For a longer holiday stay, a larger hotel with more facilities might be preferable, but with a few updates, this could be a truly excellent place to stay.",4,1768271676,3 weeks ago,en

ChIJcacvSNUEdkgRgpsgS9Y4yL4,"I would NO LONGER RECOMMEND.  We have stayed here multiple times before and it seems the hotel has taken a turn for the worse in the last two years.   Everything seems to be breaking down.

The first night we were out in a room where you could hear the party in the lobby until almost 11pm. Disappointing when you are arriving and jet lagged.  I spoke with the concierge/front desk and they said they would move us to a specific room the next day.

The next day I spoke with the hotel manager who immediately said no that room was not available. He seemed more inconvenienced than concerned.  He tried pinning the noise on the theatre next door. Either way the noise levels were unacceptable and i wouldn’t recommend for this reason.  After his refusal of the particular room we were told we were going to get we ended up in that room the second day.  The manager didn’t listen to our concerns but quickly rebutted them
Giving the impression he didn’t care or want to put effort.  It was easier for him to just say no.  Not once did I feel he took our concerns with care.

But wait theres more!

The hotel has two elevators neither of which have been serviced in some time.  Broken buttons, one of them would not accept guests from the main floor and the other had issues going to ground level.  In one instance we boarded and started towards ground floor and just stopped on the 4th floor loosing its destination trapping us in the elevator for about 5 minutes.  The call button wouldn’t work and finally after some panic it finally allowed us out and we used the stairs.

The hotel rooms used to be well taken care of.  Sadly not anymore.  Drapes were falling off the wall, big long black hairs in the bathroom and on the bed from housekeeping I presume as my partner is bald and I have a crew cut so it was not ours. The safety handle in the tub had been removed or broken off with rusty bolts and mounting gear sticking out.

Sadly we will be finding a new hotel which won’t be a problem in London.

We were warmly welcomed back to the hotel every time with the door held open and the staff was warm, chatting with us about things they recommend checking out.

The bed/pillows was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel - SO comfy and a delight to fall into after a long day of exploring. I also appreciated the little things they provided such as comfy robes, slippers, sturdy umbrellas, and some complementary mini-bar treats.

We initially had an issue with the window not closing fully but the staff came INSTANTLY and fixed it right up. They were overall SO quick with any request we had (such as extra coffee pods, extra silverware) and the room was lovingly cleaned and linens replaced every day.

Some things to note but not negatives: the infrastructure is a bit older than some modern hotels, but I found it very charming overall (i.e. the heat/AC controls were a little tricky, the lights were on a funny timer, the room was small-ish, and we could hear some upstairs noise).

We were told there is a “kids menu” costing tens of pounds, which honestly makes little sense for a child just over one year old.

I am from Qatar and wear a headscarf. On several occasions, staff members spoke directly to my husband without acknowledging me or even making eye contact. This felt strange and uncomfortable. I am unsure whether they assumed it was inappropriate to address me directly or assumed I could not speak English. Either way, it was disappointing. I travel frequently to Europe and the United States, and I have never experienced this kind of treatment before.

I reference other five star hotels in major cities, especially London, that I have stayed in.  The Rosewood London is very good, but a tad not quite there.
To be fair, the staff are wonderul.  Everyone I interacted with was first rate.  From doormen to front desk to housekeeper, all wonderful.  That includes the reservation staff who emailed me about my early check in request.  All were a joy to deal with.  Kudos to the entire team, at least the ones I saw.
I stayed two separate times within 6 days, using London as a layover for my trip west.  Both times I booked a premier executive room, hoping to score an upgrade since I used the Amex FHR program.  Both times I failed to catch a break.  Not that they have to, of course.  The hotel must be totally full on both occasiins then.  Right?  And the second stay?  What a great room with a view of AC units and construction next door (see pics).  Not the hotel's fault, of course, that these things were there.  But not what I had hoped.
In the room on my second stay, the toilet us located right next to the entrance to the shower.  Kinda squeezed and it's quite easy to drag your towel onto the toilet rim.  Not very nice.
No luggage rack per se, so I placed the luggage on the stool at the foot of the bed.  And then moved thr stool to the middle of the room because I really didn't want the dirtt luggage surface to touch the bed.  Am I weird?  I think not.
Oh, the hotel provides a sense of welcome with a welcome amenity.  Three, yes count them, three mandarin oranges.  Better than nothing I guess.
Something else annoys me.  They put a service charge to the bill for the room and for the restaurant.  Fine.  But then they say the service charge is not included in the hotel credit I get.  In other words, I have to pay extra for the service charge THEY put on even if my total restaurant bill comes below the allowed credit.  Come again?  I could ask for the service charge to be removed,bai guess.  But that's not my point.  They impose something on the customer, albeit ""voluntary,"" and then say it's extra to the creditbupu you get.  There's someting unsavoury about this nickle and diming for a hotel this calibre.

My friend and I have been frequent guests over the years: dining in their restaurants, visiting all three bars, having lunch and dinner there, and even staying at the hotel multiple times. We were well known to the staff and always felt welcome - until today.

Today, an incident occurred that completely spoiled our day, our mood, and our desire to return - even to the restaurant.

We simply walked in to make a reservation for one of the hotel’s restaurants for next week. My friend was holding a takeaway coffee. At the entrance, a woman (possibly a concierge) looked at us and, in a cold and unfriendly tone, asked: “Can I help you?” — not as a polite greeting, but as if we needed to justify our presence.

Shortly after, my friend was asked to leave the hotel entirely because she had a takeaway coffee. The way this was handled felt unnecessary, inhospitable, and frankly humiliating - especially for regular guests who have supported this hotel for years.

I asked to speak to a manager. He apologised -which I appreciate - but the damage was already done.

Luxury is not just about interiors or reputation. It is about how people are made to feel. Unfortunately, one unprofessional interaction was enough to turn what was once my favourite hotel in London into a place I no longer feel welcome in.

Yes — the Connaught Martini is worth it.

This is a masterclass in restraint and precision: table-side customisation via the iconic martini trolley, The Connaught’s own gin, bespoke bitters, and a choice of vermouths, all delivered with calm, faultless service. The result is a refined, layered martini that’s far beyond the standard.

ChIJiTyvxdcEdkgRIE3fJmxwzVM,"Extremely disappointing experience – Poor service and lack of inclusivity

I had a deeply unsettling experience at The Connaught this Boxing Day that has ensured I will never return.

After dining in Mayfair, my two friends and I decided to head to the bar at the Connaught for a nightcap. I specifically called ahead to confirm their hours given it was boxing day; the staff member on the phone explicitly told me the bar was open until 1:00 AM, with last orders at 12:30 AM. I even asked if a booking would be required to which he assured me it would not.

Upon arriving at 12:08, we were met by groups of loud individuals loitering outside. Inside the lobby, the first thing we noticed was a pungent smell of urine. For a hotel of this reputation, the physical state of the reception was shocking—it has moved past ""classic charm"" into being visibly dilapidated and in need of urgent renovation.

The most distressing part of the evening, however, occurred as we approached the bar. A member of the front desk staff (an Irish gentleman) literally ran toward us to intercept us, aggressively stating the bar was closed. Even after I showed him my call logs proving I had been told otherwise just minutes prior, he remained dismissive and unapologetic. Despite his claims, the bar was clearly bustling with patrons inside.

The way we were approached—being run at as if we were common criminals—left us feeling targeted, racially profiled, and unwelcome. It was a humiliating encounter that ruined our holiday evening.

This establishment clearly needs to invest in modernizing its facilities and, more importantly, providing rigorous sensitivity and diversity training for its front-of-house staff.

Exceptional Stay – Highly Recommended!

I recently stayed at this hotel and was absolutely blown away by the experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff was warm, welcoming, and incredibly attentive. The check-in process was smooth, and I was even offered a complimentary drink while I waited.

The room was spotless, stylishly decorated, and equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay—plush bedding, a spacious bathroom, and a beautiful view from the balcony. Housekeeping did a fantastic job each day, keeping everything pristine.

One of the highlights was the on-site restaurant. The food was outstanding, with a great variety of options for breakfast and dinner. I also appreciated the hotel’s amenities—especially the pool and fitness center, which were both clean and well-maintained.

The location is a real highlight. Battersea Park is directly opposite and Battersea Power Station is a short walk away, which is great for food, shopping and walks.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the blackout curtains were excellent. The spa facilities were clean and quiet when we used them, though quite small, and the gym is very limited.

There were some disappointments for a hotel at this price point. The room I booked wasn’t set up as requested, the walls were thin, and the room felt under-stocked (limited toiletries and tea/coffee). Breakfast was probably the weakest part of the stay: items ran out quickly, there was no self-serve hot drinks machine, and guests often had to ask staff for basics like cutlery, bowls or coffee. Staff service was mixed – some were helpful and pleasant, while others came across as abrupt, and one hygiene issue I observed was concerning.

Email comms and front of house staff not good at all in my experience, very shocked and was disappointed with the room and overall stay. Our butler was a disaster - everything was wrong, had organised something at a specific time to arrive and completely missed the mark - and timing. On our last night he chased us down the corridor with a light jog to let us know he had arranged the room for us and we won’t see him again so to be sure to write about our experience. We assumed the following, which felt like hassling, was to ensure we remembered to tip. Would never not tip, ever, but felt very disappointed by the “chase” as we called it. By arranged the room he meant turn down had been done - there was not even so much as a chocolate on the pillow. Upon this turn down, water hadn’t even been re stocked, and with no kettle in the room anyway, left us needing to call for more. The butler ignored the bell call 😂 we didn’t get it.

Service in all the dining areas and the doormen was wonderful, food very good. And yes Michael in the library as mentioned below many times really is a superstar - what a gem they have in their team. Kieran and Daniel at the front also great.

(visited sunday)
Security: questionable handling of surveillance and data privacy. As someone familiar with digital security, I found their approach potentially unsafe.

The app: requests excessive permissions and seems to collect more personal data than necessary.

Staff attitude: witnessed extremely unprofessional and disrespectful behaviour toward clients.

Cleanliness: serious hygiene issues in the wet area; it didn’t seem properly maintained.

Smell: strong and unpleasant chemical odour that lingered afterwards, even after proper washing.

Value for money: overpriced services, low-quality towels, and extra charges for replacements. Bringing your own items is not allowed, which forces you to buy their expensive products.

Clientele: mostly older visitors; the place might not meet expectations if you’re looking for a social or energetic environment.

Competitors: other venues nearby offer a much better and cleaner experience for the same or lower price.

Tourist experience: not very friendly to non-locals; staff are reluctant to repeat rules or explain things clearly in English.

ChIJEaQtLtUEdkgRKpU4uO6RjGA,"Please note: this review is predominantly about the customer service at head office and the general running of Fitness First. While I can’t say anything particularly positive about the staff at the gyms, I also can’t say anything overtly negative.

Over the two years I was a member of Fitness First, I changed gyms three times. I started at the Tottenham Court Road gym and was genuinely impressed by the facilities and what it offered. However, this location closed, and although we were expected to pay the same membership fee at the new gym, there was a significant drop in standards. This was the Marylebone location, which I eventually left due to how poor it was, not enough facilities, unhelpful staff, and absolutely not worth the price being charged. The selling points of the cold plunge and sauna were irrelevant as the sauna was smaller than Tottenham Court Road and the cold plunge didnt work over the 3 months I was there.

I then moved to the Oxford Circus gym. While it is very small, there is a good community of regulars. That said, it gets extremely busy, and it’s often not an ideal environment to train in.

The biggest issue with Fitness First, however, is how the company is run. There is no genuine customer interaction, and there seems to be a large disconnect from what I think should be more than a bog-standard gym. Head office refuses to speak on the phone and can take up to a week to respond to emails. When challenged about being forced to move gyms, you’re simply told you’re tied into a contract and therefore can’t leave.

I recently decided that I was tired of paying a high price for the bare minimum, so I chose to leave. The repercussions of this decision have been a nightmare. I cancelled through the app and was told I had nothing left to pay. A few days later, I received an email stating my account was overdue. When I called the Oxford Circus gym (the only location you can actually phone), I was met with a sarcastic response: “You should know you can’t just cancel your direct debit.” This is not what I did, nor what I would ever do.

This situation ultimately resulted in complete silence from head office once they became involved, and I was left having to pay regardless of the circumstances.

I would not recommend Fitness First if you’re looking to elevate your fitness experience beyond that of a cheap commercial gym. Fitness First is exactly that — a cheap commercial gym, just with a much higher monthly cost.

I do not recommend.",1,1766139046,a month ago,en

Yes it is small compared to the non-city centre warehouse style gyms but this is zone 1 in London and it definitely stands in line with most other local gyms. It has a great size gym floor stocked with continually renewed machines, a sprung floor studio plus spin studio.

A special mention has to go to Mark, one of the personal trainers—he’s absolutely fantastic. Not only is he incredibly knowledgeable and professional, but he’s also genuinely supportive and motivating. Mark takes the time to understand your individual goals and tailors each session to push you in the right direction without ever feeling overwhelming.

The gym itself is spacious, well-equipped with high-quality machines, and has the added bonus of a swimming pool, sauna and steam room.

However, the cleanliness of the steam room and the entrance area of it, often leaves much to be desired, as water tends to remain stagnant.

On a couple of occasions, I have asked a trainer to explain how to use a particular machine correctly, but I was ignored, which left me feeling as though help is reserved only for those paying for personal training sessions. For this reason, I prefer not to ask again.

Aside from these points, I really do like this gym and appreciate what it offers.",4,1758636204,4 months ago,en
ChIJz1OtwzcbdkgRImJXfqcVLhk,"I am writing to formally raise serious concerns regarding the overall standards at this branch, which, in my experience, are significantly below those of other branches.

Firstly, the level of customer service is extremely poor. Staff members appear to lack the necessary skills, training, and professionalism required to handle customer enquiries or complaints effectively. Concerns raised are not addressed constructively, and there is a general absence of accountability.

In particular, the branch manager (a European female) has repeatedly dismissed legitimate concerns regarding facilities. Rather than attempting to resolve issues, her standard response has been that customers are free to cancel their subscriptions. This approach is unprofessional and demonstrates a disregard for customer satisfaction and brand reputation.

Additionally, the condition and availability of facilities are unacceptable:
•	The swimming pool and steam room have been closed for over ten days.
•	The men’s underwear dryer has been out of service for approximately two months.
•	Only two men’s showers are functioning correctly; the remaining showers are either broken or do not provide consistent hot or cold water.
•	The disabled shower has been continuously dripping water, indicating a lack of maintenance.

There are also ongoing concerns regarding staff conduct. The branch has gained a negative reputation among members, with reports that male staff members spend excessive time socialising with female customers. Allegations include inappropriate behaviour, including forming personal relationships and engaging in intimate conduct while on duty and in uniform. Such behaviour is wholly unacceptable and damages the professionalism and integrity of the brand.

Despite the declining quality of service and facilities, the branch has recently increased its monthly membership fees. This is extremely disappointing and unjustifiable given the current conditions.

It is also concerning that the branch manager appears to operate as though she has full ownership authority, rather than representing the company’s values and policies. This has resulted in a dismissive culture where customer concerns are not taken seriously.

I strongly urge regional management or ownership to intervene, review staffing and management practices at this branch, and address the ongoing facilities issues. Immediate attention is required to protect the brand’s reputation and ensure members receive the level of service they are paying for.

I hope this matter will be reviewed promptly and taken seriously.",1,1767821643,4 weeks ago,en

Leya is, without question, one of the most outstanding Pilates instructors I’ve ever worked with. Her sessions strike that rare balance of being calming, challenging, and completely engaging from start to finish. She brings a passion to her teaching that you can feel the moment you walk into the room.

What sets Leya apart is her incredible attention to detail.

She has a gift for helping you understand your body better, guiding you into proper alignment in a way that feels empowering and safe.

Her classes are genuinely welcoming for everyone whether you’re a complete beginner or someone with years of experience. Leya offers clear, accessible options for every level, making sure each person can work at a pace that feels right for them while still progressing.

ChIJ7Ru8ScwadkgRPPUUkYXskZE,"My experience with this company has been disappointing from day one. I was overcharged at the start of my membership, the Baker Street gym often had no hot water, and when I raised this, a staff member told me it was “not their fault” because management had emailed members. Towels regularly had an unpleasant smell.

The issues became worse when I tried to cancel. From 27 October onward, I emailed several times requesting cancellation, yet my messages were ignored. When they eventually replied, the responsibility was shifted back onto me — first claiming I had emailed the “generic” address, then explaining that Chelsi could not respond because she was off. No one acknowledged the clear communication failures on their side.

I also reported that my app did not show the cancellation option. They were aware of this problem but did nothing to resolve it, leaving me unable to cancel through the required process. Despite that, I was still charged for an additional month, even though my login was inactive.

A simple cancellation request turned into 6 weeks of unanswered emails, conflicting explanations and misplaced blame.

A super nice woman named June was working the front desk and she was very helpful getting me checked in. The gym was clean and the locker room was very nice and clean as well. I bought a day pass as I was traveling the next day. The cost was shocking! £25 for a single day pass! I pay this much at home for a month! I bit the bullet and paid it as I was commited due the the proximity of my hotel and lack of time to look for another gym. The gym was well furnished (machines, free weights, mats, etc) and the equipment was newer and in good shape. I worked out for 70 minutes and although it was a busy time (6:00pm), I was able to mostly get the equipment i needed when I wanted it. Plenty of benches and free weights available but machines quite busy. In addition to the cost, I wasn't pleased with the volume of the music.

Alexis always greets me with the sweetest smile at reception, and Ty has been an exceptional trainer during my sessions. He’s super attentive, supportive, and genuinely cares about client progress.

Also, a big thank you to the General Manager who kindly offered me a protein shake - small touches like that make the environment feel like a real community or second home.

One thing I really appreciate is that management takes feedback seriously. I raised a couple of small points previously, and they were addressed efficiently - that kind of responsiveness goes a long way!

Some (new) suggestions for improvement:
•	A StairMaster would be a great addition, perhaps replacing one of the treadmills.
•	A hip abduction machine would also be amazing if possible.
•	A filtered water station that offers cold still and sparkling water instead of the current tap fountain.
•	A mirror behind or in front of the cable machines would help with form correction during workouts.

Other than that, everything is excellent - including the overall cleanliness and hygiene of both the gym floor and women’s changing rooms. The cleaner works extremely hard, and it’s always spotless whenever I’m in there. I also love the women’s-only sauna near the showers, the great class options, and the overall vibe. Excellent location too - situated inside the station so very easy to catch train right after.

After being injured and unable to train, my membership fell into arrears and was passed directly to a debt collection company. Despite explaining my circumstances and trying to resolve the issue, I was repeatedly told that Fitness First could not help and that everything must go through DebtCo, including cancellation.

There was no flexibility, no face-to-face support, and no real effort to resolve the issue as a loyal member. The experience felt impersonal and stressful, especially during a difficult time financially and medically. I expected much better customer care.",1,1767021420,a month ago,en
ChIJZUXuY0YDdkgReo2kb5eer-k,"I joined this gym based on the volume of positive reviews, but in reality it has been a major disappointment and represents extremely poor value for money, particularly at ~£109 per month.

The facilities are in a poor state. The gym feels persistently damp, and much of the equipment shows visible rust and wear. The range of equipment is also limited compared to other gyms at this price point, making it difficult to train properly without compromise.

The most serious issue is the changing facilities. The male changing rooms are currently closed for renovation. They were sub-standard before, and the temporary solution is frankly unacceptable. Members are told to change in a tiny room in the corner of the gym, which realistically fits no more than three people. On my last visit, we were crammed into this space, no room to move, no privacy, and very limited secure storage. There are only a handful of lockers available. It completely undermines the service being paid for. Despite this, members are still being charged full price.

The two-month cancellation notice period is not clearly highlighted during sign-up. It may be in the small print, but it is certainly not obvious, which only adds to the sense of poor transparency.

Overall, this is one of the worst gym facilities I have used relative to cost. Unless there is a significant improvement or acknowledgement of the reduced service currently being offered, I cannot recommend this gym to anyone.",1,1768994643,2 weeks ago,en

When we decided to cancel, reception told us August would be our final month, so we cancelled the direct debit as instructed. After a long email exchange where they complained about “one month’s written notice” (which no one ever mentioned at the time), they finally agreed in writing to cancel both memberships.

Then today — 18 October 2025 — I woke up to an email from a debt collection agency saying I owe them money. After they confirmed our cancellation themselves! This is beyond ridiculous.

Nuffield Health clearly can’t honour their own agreements, treat members with respect, or ensure a safe environment. Total disgrace — avoid this place at all costs.",1,1760785296,3 months ago,en

ChIJmT0tgLocdkgRax7q17p399A,"The instructors and their classes are great at Nuffield Shoreditch and reception staff friendly. But the maintenance and management is terrible.

The air con in the studio has been broken more often than working over the last 2 years, leading to unbearably hot high intensity classes and freezing cold yoga. Management has tried to blame members for breaking it and staff - never taking responsibility, apologising, or giving a date when it will be fixed.

When referred up the chain to the operations manager, he wouldn’t give me a straight answer, just rolling out the same old excuses about staff and members causing the problems and saying he couldn’t estimate when they’d get the parts to fix the air con! That’s his JOB.

Nobody wants to take accountability for anything here. I would never choose Nuffield as my healthcare provider, given the lack of care they show to the health and well-being of members of their gym.",2,1764192186,2 months ago,en

ChIJyVADstMadkgReZXDv3P5DxI,"BEWARE!!

I’ve noticed this clinic has quietly deleted dozens of negative reviews over the past few months. I know this because I had written one myself before, and I’ve seen many other people sharing similar experiences.

This clinic takes full payment upfront, and if anything goes wrong  - for example, if your body doesn’t react well to a treatment, or you can’t continue with the procedure for health reasons — they refuse to refund even a single cent. The staff are unprofessional and poorly trained in communication, showing little empathy or understanding.

The clinic itself feels overpriced and underwhelming. There’s nothing special about the place - it looks cheap for the amount they charge, and the whole experience feels transactional rather than caring or medical.

This beauty clinic is extremely disappointing. Most of their procedures, especially the so-called fat-freezing treatments and things like Emsculpt or Emtone, produce little to no visible results. They advertise dramatic outcomes, but in reality, there’s virtually no improvement even after completing multiple sessions.

It feels like they rely heavily on marketing rather than real results. Everything seems designed to make you pay more upfront, with no accountability when treatments don’t work. Overall, the clinic gives off a fake and untrustworthy vibe, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",1,1760972913,3 months ago,en
ChIJyVADstMadkgReZXDv3P5DxI,"This review is in relation to the Peter Jones Clinic AND the Cavendish Clinic Head Office.  I can only seem to leave a google review here.

The ladies that carry out the treatments are all very lovely and good at what they do. My rating is in relation to the lack of any customer service that isn't solely related to booking an appointment.

Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it.

I've tried for over 7 months to get a call back to discuss a package of treatments that I had purchased but could not use by the expiry date due to medical reasons. Every time I call I get told the clinic manager or someone from head office will have to call me back but the call never comes and all of my emails have gone unanswered. As it stands, I have lost several hundred pounds and no-one at the Cavendish Clinic seems to remotely care or can be bothered to extend the courtesy of a simple call back.

I am not a happy customer (just in case that wasn't obvious). Based on many of the other 1 star reviews this seems to be the norm and not an exception. Great at taking your money but when it comes to the after sales customer service it basically doesn't exist.",1,1759763007,4 months ago,en

The rooms themselves are warm and cosy, and the bed is wide and warm, with an electric blanket underneath. My masseuse, Nita, and then Belle, made me feel welcome and at ease, asked me my pressure preference, and let me get settled. The massage itself was one of the best I've had in my LIFE. I usually ask for firm pressure, and often have to request more than I'm being given when it starts, but Nita has both incredible skill and sharp intuition, and found every little knot I barely knew I had, and attended it with exceptional sensitivity and the perfect pressure for my body. I cannot sing her praises enough, an incredibly talented body worker.

ChIJG_J1Xb-xe0gRw2PgWb9BaEw,"Looking at the other reviews this shan’t be a shock. I had an extremely unpleasant experience at the Superdrug on Market Street and will not be returning.

We came in knowing exactly what we needed and had been in the store for no more than 30 seconds when we were abruptly told, in an assertive and rude manner, to go to the till. After walking barely five steps, we were told again this time in a very condescending tone that the tills close at 8pm so we “couldn’t make any payments.”

This is simply untrue, as the tills were still working. Giving customers false information just to rush them out goes against the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which are meant to stop businesses from misleading customers.

If a store wants to stop serving customers before closing time, that should be clearly and honestly explained. Customers who are already in the store before closing are still entitled to be treated fairly and with basic respect.

Because of how uncomfortable the situation felt, we made our way to the till anyway. While doing so, a third member of staff looked us up and down and rudely told us that we “needed to leave.” We explained that we had already been told three times and were literally heading to the till at that moment.

The experience at the tills was even worse. No smile, no customer service, and our items were scanned and thrown onto the counter, showing a complete lack of care or professionalism. By this point it was around 7:57pm, so clearly staff wanting to close mattered more than treating customers decently. It genuinely felt like the staff were ganging up on us.

As we were leaving, the first two staff members were huddled together talking about the remaining customers, which just summed up the attitude in the store.

I understand retail can be frustrating I’ve worked in retail myself but that does not excuse being rude, misleading, or unprofessional. You’d expect better standards, especially from someone who appeared to be a manager, but this seems to reflect the overall standards at the Superdrug Market Street store. Very fitting.

ChIJtdJ5LsKxe0gRXNEBjFmI10U,"Having struggled with acne for years I finally made an appointment to see a dermatologist and was excited to start taking steps toward healing my skin. Unfortunately i left feeling deflated and extremely dissappointed. To spend such a huge amount of money and wait for a month from the time of booking to be in the room for less than 4 minutes with a specialist who offered no advice, asked almost no questions and barely looked at me apart from to shove an ipad in my face to take pictures feels like some sort of prank. The lack of empathy and depth of inquiry for somebody coming to you for advice for a condition that can affect your confidence and quality of life was truly upsetting and I cried outside. Accutane was suggested as a treatment but not discussed in detail (hard to discuss anything in detail in 4 minutes)  and I left with a prescription for a topical gel that my doctor has given me on the NHS (for free) 3 times already that stops working when the course of treatment is over. I feel as though I was given two choices: accutane or the gel and to go on accutane requires intensive health checks first and isn't an avenue I want to explore. I thought I would receive recommendations for products to use as well as lifestyle advice and maybe learn something about my skin type or a new way I can try to heal my skin however I feel as though I was just another appointment to get out of the way and another chunk of money to make from someone's suffering. If people come to you as a specialist with a medical problem they are struggling with, I truly feel they should be made to feel listened to and not rushed or dismissed, that's why people go private.
To pay an additional £40 on top of the appointment fee for something I have been prescribed by a doctor 3 times already for free feels like I have actually been robbed.  My gp has offered more sympathy and solutions despite clearly not being as well funded as this clinic and in the future I will not be coming back here for treatment or advice as I left with neither and was £250 out of pocket.

Having now read some reviews i can see that this is an ongoing problem specifically for acne appointments and that other people have left feeling the same as me. As a wellness clinic I truly hope people start getting the care they deserve from you.",1,1769112329,2 weeks ago,en
ChIJtdJ5LsKxe0gRXNEBjFmI10U,"I paid £50 to speak to a specialist because I was getting so upset trying different things for my acne scars that weren’t working. I thought that if I was paying, I would be able to get some expert advice. I don’t have lots of money, I use all spare money I do have to try and fix my skin so I really had hoped this would help. Instead, I felt as though I was the one suggesting things that might help. Many of the suggestions were ‘yes perhaps’. She in the end suggested CO2 laser, which I had enquired about originally. I was then told, they don’t actually do it in Manchester. She took photos and emailed someone in Chester, with the response ‘I have emailed, but we’re busy so it’s unlikely she will even call you back’. I feel really upset that I paid £50 to come away more confused as to what I MIGHT need, to find out they don’t do it in Manchester as advertised and they don’t really care anyway as they are too busy. I would not recommend these at all. And after speaking to other clinics after, I was told they were not recommended. Avoid.",1,1761079498,3 months ago,en

ChIJTSxJs8axe0gRutKEEH4vhs4,"I regularly shop at this Boots branch, mainly because of its convenient location in the city centre. The store layout is well-organised, and the product selection is generally very good. Under normal circumstances, I would have given a much more positive review.

However, one particular incident has completely affected my overall experience. During my most recent visit, I was at the self-checkout and needed age verification for one of my items. I waited patiently for around five or six minutes, even actively seeking assistance. Eventually, a male staff member came over, but unfortunately, his attitude was shockingly poor.

While helping the customer before me, he angrily slammed down their items, clearly showing visible signs of frustration—though I have no idea what he was frustrated about. When it was finally my turn, he didn’t say a word, brushed past me quite forcefully, tapped his card for verification, and walked away abruptly without making any eye contact or acknowledging me.

This kind of rude and dismissive behaviour is unacceptable, especially in a customer-facing environment. It left me feeling very uncomfortable and unwelcome.

It’s disappointing that such a negative interaction overshadowed what would have otherwise been a smooth and pleasant shopping trip. I sincerely hope the management takes this kind of feedback seriously and addresses the issue—a single poor attitude can drive loyal customers away.",2,1743269175,10 months ago,en

ChIJszKWpsSxe0gRY3So8aaaYxY,"I visited Retreat Salon after seeing that it was award-winning, but honestly, I don’t understand what the awards were for.

I paid £94 expecting a high-quality facial experience, but what I received was very basic — things I could have easily done myself at home. The treatment included simple makeup removal, face washing, and light exfoliation. No extractions were done, and when I asked the manager, she said: “This is what we offer, we don’t do extractions.”

The consultation with the therapist was nothing more than identifying my skin type and asking if I’m on any medication — no real discussion or skin analysis. The facial was supposed to be 50 minutes, but about 20 minutes of it was basic cleansing, and the rest was a very standard scalp and shoulder massage that didn’t feel professional or therapeutic.

On top of all that, the therapist had bad breath, which made the experience uncomfortable.

I left the salon with my skin still feeling clogged, and the blackheads were still clearly there. For £94, I expected proper care, visible results, and a level of expertise that just wasn’t there. Definitely not worth it.",1,1743844193,10 months ago,en

There are treatment rooms but no spa facilities, the ‘relaxation room’ is just two beds (not very clean) right next to two of the treatment rooms. There is no spa feel whatsoever.

The changing rooms are quite frankly, disgusting. There was dirt, mould, sewerage smell, lack of towels, extremely dated. The water in the showers also had an odd smell to it, I rinsed my hair as I’d got salt in it from the floating tank & my hair smelt like sewer water.

The floating tank experience was ok, but the room it was in was small & the shower didn’t work, which meant after the tank, you couldn’t rinse the salt off. Due to this, it meant salt went on the bed and floor in the communal areas & the staff member was rude when she saw this.

We had lunch in the bar and the food was appalling, unfortunately, I didn’t take a picture but I’d ordered a Thai chicken salad and just got given some plain chicken and some raw veg? The staff in the restaurant were also not pleasant.

The customer service, led by Grace, is outstanding, the staff set the tone with their professionalism, kindness and attention to detail. Grace makes every visit feel personal and is never rushed, and her team follow that example perfectly.

The sauna experience is exceptional. It’s deeply relaxing, therapeutic and noticeably improves how I felt both physically and mentally - melts away the stress!  After just one session I felt lighter, calmer and revitalised.

I don’t generally write reviews but I want to share my experience because the guys deserve a positive review! So, if you need a treatment or massage (massively recommended!) you will definitely be very well looked after here!

As we told them the music was annoying us and we couldn’t relax there response was laughing saying “ you should come earlier always loud banging on weekends”.

ChIJcWbonbyxe0gRyFUxuOonqqc,"I had a balayage treatment with Carole and (I’m sorry I didn’t quite catch her name, I think it’s Rose?) yesterday and, wow.

Firstly and honestly, I know the price is probably considerably higher than your local salon down the road, I get that. It took me a while to just ‘bite the bullet’ and book the appointment - but wow, I am SO glad I did. I have found my new regular, go-to salon after years of searching! Although it financially stings that my now-firm-favourite salon is perhaps considered ‘high end’ -  it is the definition of you get what you pay for, and I am more than happy to do so!
I had two, sometimes three hair stylists working on my hair at all times - I honestly felt like royalty, or a VIP at the least!😅 I’ve never been treated so well in a salon, I can’t even describe it! It made the world of difference to my whole experience and I was just beaming. Carole and the team worked MIRACLES on my hair, I could not stop smiling from the moment my hair was dry (so I was able to see it properly), to when I left 40 mins later and that was only because I couldn’t see my hair anymore! The colour is even better than the inspiration photos I showed, and the roots blend into my lengths so seamlessly, I’ve never know anything like this artistry to be honest! The cut and style is also phenomenal - the neatest and overall best haircut I’ve ever had! I cannot thank Carole and Rose(?) enough for the self-confidence and happiness in my hair they have given me.

They were all so beyond lovely, friendly and kind too. Honestly incredible treatment and experience from beginning to end, I just love my hair now so much and it means so much to me that I can finally say I do love it!
I actually can’t wait to go back for my roots refresh and to treat myself to their keratin hair treatments and Brazilian blow dry over my next few appointments!🥰",5,1761068114,3 months ago,en
ChIJcWbonbyxe0gRyFUxuOonqqc,"I have been going to Carole for years now and there is no better salon in Manchester, especially for blondes. The colour remains a beautiful shade of blonde even after the toner fades which no other salon has managed to achieve as it tends to go brassy over time. Due to the high quality products the salon uses this never happens and my hair quality has never been better. Carole always takes the time before the appointment to understand what colour and style I want to go for and no ask is ever too much. The service at Antonacci is extremely professional and all the staff are so kind and polite. I would never go to another salon now I have Antonacci and Carole. Thanks so much for my perfect blonde hair! 🩷",5,1762104617,3 months ago,en

The lady was called ""Sofie', and she was very attentive and friendly. I had a 90 minute massage, which was a combination of ""hot stone"" massage, and manual, and also ""Thai style"", where she uses her body weight to add pressure and to stretch. She made sure I was comfortable, and that the pressure was the way I wanted it.  Its not a fancy place, but it's; clean, warm, affordable and I was very well looked after.

ChIJ0_4eQbqxe0gRunlYHBzx-PA,"*Edited AGAIN to respond to more lies below. As I said on my initial edit, no-one on the phone mentioned a junk folder, so how could someone apologise for something that was never discussed? Maybe this happens a lot and you are confusing me with another customer. Also your insane lie about me mentioning reviews is disgusting. I'm not an influencer and don't try to be, I didn't even realise I had that many reviews, you have obviously just counted and then lied, or if indeed you were threatened, it was a different customer!
You could have just owned the fact that mistakes were made your end, I did on my review below when I said that I expected nothing as the voucher was out of date. If you had just apologised for not apologising, I would have tweaked this review, but you have doubled down with more lies. Absolutely mind blowing.
I am tempted to issue a Subject Access Request in the hopes that your calls are recorded to prove that you are lying about our call!

*Edited my review to add this - the owner has replied to say they mentioned something about my emails going into their Junk folder - this is just a lie, no-one on the phone mentioned a junk folder or apologised for ignoring my emails, now you look worse for lying rather than just owning it*

I bought a voucher for my wife for Christmas 2024.

Fast forward to October this year and we decide it's time to use it, not realising it's a 6 month expiry and not 12 months.

Completely my fault, didn't realise.

I email Youth Spa to see if anything can be done, no reply. I wait a week and email again, no reply.

Finally 2 weeks later I thought I best call up, in case I'm getting the email wrong only to be told that they did receive my emails but the expiry date is a hard rule.

This rating isn't because they couldn't do anything with the expiration date, that's on me. This rating is because they ignored my 2 emails rather than just letting me down gently.

Its a real shame I didn't get the chance to experience the spa, I can see lots of good ratings, but I can only go off the service that I received.",1,1768821754,2 weeks ago,en

My parents enjoyed their stay at the hotel. They said it was pretty clean and comfortable, and they especially enjoyed the bar. The said the bar staff were brilliant and couldn't have been more helpful.

However, what is letting this hotel down is customer service. As I couldn't attend but was concerned about using the app to cancel when we still needed two other rooms, I spoke with a Hotels.com chat agent who tried to contact the hotel on my behalf but couldn't get a response.

I also wanted to arrange something special in the room for my mam's arrival and had used the app at time of booking to ask what was available. I never got a response via the app so a few days before the trip I emailed the hotel directly. Responses back and forth took so long that in the end they weren't able to set anything up as by this point it was check in day and I was told balloons were arranged via a third party.

I asked if there was anything at all that could be done to make her stay extra special while she was there as it was a 2 night trip, and they completely stopped responding.

However, the spa facilities were disappointing. The relaxation area was overcrowded, leaving us sitting on chairs rather than loungers, which didn’t feel particularly relaxing. The room was also quite chilly. There is also no swimming pool, which was a major letdown. Describing this as “spa facilities” feels misleading when it consists solely of a sauna- we had expected at least a steam room and pool.

To make matters worse, another guest was loudly talking on the phone in the relaxation area, and there was no staff presence to manage this or maintain a calm environment, as everyone was occupied with treatments.

On a positive note, the restaurant service was excellent and the food was delicious. The team kindly moved our restaurant booking an hour earlier when we decided we’d had enough of the sauna and noise, which we appreciated.",1,1767371346,a month ago,en

ChIJk2GwJbyxe0gRyAWX-vDjkoU,"Let me be clear!
I was surprised by the number of negative reviews, but as someone who visits gay bathhouses wherever I travel, I had to stop by during my visit to Manchester. Unfortunately, I couldn’t enter the venue this time because I forgot my ID (and yes, it’s standard practice for bathhouses across most European countries to ask for identification, which is perfectly fine). I’ll come back and update my review once I actually experience the venue itself.

But one important thing: there are dozens of negative reviews about the receptionist, the “guy with glasses,” as many call him. Well, I met him too, and we had a lovely chat. I asked him about the negative feedback, and he explained who usually writes those reviews (guess who is not allowed to enter and gets pissed 🚭🚯💊💉).

He also clarified the so‑called “cold shower” issue, which makes total sense: when 100+ men  on busy days keep pressing the shower buttons constantly, hot water for  the boiler doesn’t always have enough time to reheat the water. So it’s not the staff’s fault; it’s just how the system works in their case. Take a quick shower - you’re not at home!

Overall, I had a great impression of the guy. So please, keep your judgment balanced when leaving negative reviews. I’ll definitely be back.

We enjoyed breakfast and room service within the hotel itself with a great choice offered for both. I visited their spa which is based in the adjoining building. I enjoyed a blissful massage and as a guest of the hotel was then able to stay and enjoy the other communal facilities of the spa on a complimentary basis.

ChIJCxgVD8Oxe0gRFJL-RfpUyhU,"I’m so disappointed.
I’m sad to write this as Ive been here quite a few times and always had a 10/10 experience but today was just a whole lot of disappointment.
We were booked into a couples massage and the session started off fantastic even though there was a lot of leaving the room and coming back and forth by the masseuse’s.
None the less, my partner and I settled in nicely… started off on the back massage… fabulous only for mine, to be cut short by a ‘swop’ of therapist, mid way through.
I completely understand that popular therapist will be booked but to be (what seemed like) fobbed off with someone who had no clue as to what they were doing is upsetting.
I am a massage therapist myself and when I voiced my concern that I was just getting a ‘rub of the leg’, yes, the pressure did get more intense but it was still just a rub down, no muscle manipulation or kneading. I stopped the massage myself  and explained that I knew the lady was not a masseuse…. Without hesitation she apologised and admitted she was not qualified. With this i got myself dressed and watched on as my partner enjoyed his massage and I left the room.
The staff were lovely and I am not faulting their kindness. They even gave me £20 refund which is a lovely gesture but I’m just so gutted that I didn’t get to enjoy my experience as I have done before x",1,1754583681,6 months ago,en

ChIJCxgVD8Oxe0gRFJL-RfpUyhU,"I can see I’m not the only one writing bad review about this place.
I was so excited to go for couple Thai massage.
The two therapist ladies wouldn’t stop talking and laughing while doing our treatment. Relaxing music was to low and they were taking turns answer phone in the corridor.

After I looked at the lady, so she would take a hint that treatment has to be done in silence. She started to be extremely nasty to my body like she wanted to release all her life problems on me.

When she walked over me to prep my body for the treatment she was not really stretching but trying to harm me. Put all her body weight on one heel and moving left and right to dig and whole in by back.

It was no single moment during the treatment that I enjoyed. My body was scared tensed all the time.
The way she was grabbing my neck was insane. Not starting slowly and then increasing pressure. But nasty grabbing my neck or any other body part from the start.
To grab my shoulders she used rough cotton cloth that I thought will strip my skin away.
The way she was pressing my temples. I thought I will faint from pain.

My body was in bits for days. I couldn’t function for 2 days. I have bruise on my arm and still lots of pain all over my body.

I had Thai or sport massage many times.
This was something else!
Absolutely insane.
No work or human ethics.

She never asked if pressure was okay. And even when I moved a lot to show that it hurts she wouldn’t care.
They asked for money upfront.
After the treatment I wanted to cry that it was all done for my money that I paid and I was in a pain shock and wanted to get home as soon as I can.",1,1742377352,10 months ago,en

The atmosphere here is incredibly friendly. Both the club members and all the staff are genuinely nice and helpful, which makes such a difference to my motivation. A huge shoutout must go to the cleaning team—the gym and changing rooms are always immaculately clean.

Facilities and Layout

The facilities here are brilliant and cater to all my needs. The swimming pool, sauna, and steam room—they are perfect for winding down after a hard session. The changing room facilities and showers are also very good and well-maintained.

The gym layout itself is fantastic, offering diverse training areas. I especially enjoy the Functional Training area, complete with the sled track.

Classes and Timetable

The classes and timetable offer plenty of choice and are always well-organised. My personal favourites are the high-energy Met Con and Circuits sessions and the calming Body Balance class.

Personal Trainer Recommendation: Dan Nottingham

Finally, if you are looking for a personal trainer, I cannot recommend Dan Nottingham highly enough. I’ve been training with Dan for three years now, and he is absolutely superb. He's knowledgeable, motivating, and his guidance has been a core part of my fitness journey. The gym staff and all the personal trainers, in general, are great, but Dan is truly exceptional.

ChIJZyOPHMexe0gR8TwHaxZHLRY,"First of all, the cleaning staff are absolutely spot on - I didn’t catch his name, but the core cleaner in the men’s changing room does an amazing job. He’s always cheerful, helpful, and keeps everything immaculate. The sauna, steam room, and swimming facilities are also really good and clearly well maintained — you can see regular checks being done, which is great to see.

Now, onto the rest. The actual gym staff
aren’t helpful at all - same goes for the reception team. They just don’t seem interested and the customer service is really poor. It gives off the impression that they couldn’t care less about members, which is disappointing considering the price point of this gym.

The gym itself feels dated, with worn-out equipment that’s long overdue an upgrade. There’s much better kit and value for money at other gyms in Manchester that cost far less. The layout is also frustrating - it makes no sense at all. For example, there’s a dumbbell rack placed directly behind a barbell thrust machine, so when someone’s using it, you can’t even access the weights rack. It’s just poor design and really inconvenient.

Overall, the cleaning and spa facilities are a credit to the place, but the actual gym area and staff experience seriously let it down. It feels like it’s running on reputation rather than quality - definitely not worth the premium membership cost.",2,1760121618,3 months ago,en

ChIJE9dBQ0awe0gR_SQGxy_awsc,"I currently pay for two memberships at £39 each at this 'community gym'. However, several ongoing issues are making it difficult to feel that the membership offers real value.

The £3 fee for each class cancellations within four hours is discouraging and doesn’t reflect an understanding of members’ reallife schedules. Combined with a limited and repetitive class timetable, it feels like we’re being charged extra without being given enough choice or flexibility in return, no variations just mostly dance classes and not enough allround
Access to training spaces is also restricted. The back room is kept closed outside of classes, which means there’s no open mat area for stretching or functional work. Most of the dumbbells are locked away, further limiting what members can actually use.

Cleanliness is inconsistent, and in the women’s gym the Stairmaster has been broken for months with no updates or repairs. For a facility that encourages community engagement, these maintenance gaps are noticeable.

ChIJq1oddZaxe0gRJP31WUlY8D0,"Regrettably, our visit to Harmony and Serenity Spa at Manchester Hotel Piccadilly left much to be desired. The experience began on a sour note as the lack of clear directions coupled with the ongoing construction made locating the spa entrance a challenge. Upon expressing our concerns at the hotel reception, we were met with indifference rather than understanding or an apology for the inconvenience caused by the construction.

Navigating through the maze from the hotel reception to the spa, we were informed of an afternoon tea arrangement, only to discover that the changing rooms were inconveniently located in a separate area, resembling unused hotel rooms with inadequate privacy due to large windows. Furthermore, the relaxation room offered anything but tranquility, with the incessant noise of drilling disrupting any hope of relaxation.

Disappointingly, despite being informed of the availability of massages, we were informed upon attempting to utilize the spa facilities that they were not ready for use. The cleanliness of the premises also left much to be desired, with unclean stairs and malfunctioning saunas detracting from the overall experience. Additionally, the afternoon tea provided fell short of expectations, with small portions failing to satisfy.

The culmination of these issues led to a decision to cut short our visit, as the overall experience fell far short of our expectations.

ChIJq1oddZaxe0gRJP31WUlY8D0,"The Spa was anything but relaxing. Booked the Spa deal for 2 with Prosecco on arrival and afternoon tea. We had upgraded our 25 minute treatment to a 50 minute treatment and paid for everything before arriving over the phone.
Upon arrival we were told to go to the 2nd floor to the Spa reception. Here we filled a questionnaire in asking if we had any allergies etc. After this we were sent to the first floor to the changing rooms, which were basically a hotel room with the bed removed (do they not have such rooms on the 2nd floor closer to the Spa? This may have prevented us from walking up and down corridors and going in and out of lifts full of workmen in our bath robes).
After getting changed we found our way back to the second floor where we used the sauna and steam room. One of the saunas was out of use which made us have to wait near the showers until the small sauna that was working was free. We spent about 40 minutes in this area but as its only small, we decided to go for a cup of tea in the relaxation room.
This room was very untidy, all the cups were just left on the tables, chairs all messy and cushions too. I had to ask the receptionist for clean cups as there were none, no one seemed to be replenishing cups or keeping the area tidy at all. The teabags were almost gone and there was no sugar either. All in all not very appealing as a relaxation suite. We waited around 20 minutes for her to return and then decided to go back to the sauna as we had got tired of waiting.
We now went to lie on the heated loungers but that lasted about five minutes as the sound of the workmen's drills, saws and them singing/shouting to one another in the next room was unbearable. I know you mention on your website that a refurbishment is taking place, so I expected a little disruption, but you also state that this does not affect your Spa experience at all. This is not true, there is no Spa experience on a building site!.
Back to the Spa reception area we went.
As the tea cups were now replenished, we thought we would ask when our afternoon tea would be served as we thought we could have that now with the cups of tea.
The receptionist looked on the computer and smuggly told me my afternoon tea was at 12pm and as it was now 13.30, I had missed it. I said ""excuse me, what do you mean"" she smirked and said ""it was booked on for 12.00 so it's too late now""
I reminded her that we had arrived at 11.50am so in plenty of time but that there had been no prosecco on arrival as promised and no mention of the afternoon tea, so being polite we had decided to wait until it was served to us. The receptionist looked at me as if I was asking too much of her and she said she could rebook it for me for 2pm. Then she told me it was in the restaurant on the 2nd floor!! Sorry??? So now as a part of this ""relaxing Spa day"" I have to go back to the first floor, get dressed, go to the second floor, passing countless workmen carrying mattresses and other things over the landings to get my afternoon tea at 2pm? then eat it as quick as I can because I have then got to go back to the first floor, put my wet bathing clothes back on, then it's back in the lift in my bathrobe because I have my treatment booked in at 3pm in the Spa area on the 2nd floor.
This has nothing to do with the hotel having a refurbishment, this is just shocking service. I have been to many spas all over the world and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. I would like some kind of compensation for a terrible Spa day.",2,1696423471,2 years ago,en

Feeling frustrated and desperate for change, I decided to explore alternative therapies and discovered Ray Haq - Kinesiology and Structural Release Therapy. At that point, I was willing to try anything that might help me live more comfortably.

Just four weeks into my treatment, I can honestly say I am incredibly grateful for the difference Ray has made in my life. Within only two sessions, the pain in my back and shoulders was gone. My posture has improved dramatically, and without even realising it at first, my mindset has become more positive and balanced in my day-to-day life.

As the treatment continues, I’m also becoming aware of areas in my body that had underlying issues I never even realised were there. Addressing these has made a huge difference, and I’m continuing with my treatment to help me feel 100% back to myself.

My posture has also improved enormously and my body feels more open and less physically restricted than it has in years. For me though, the most significant change has been in my mindset, emotional resilience and general experience of life.

ChIJr7GK597Le0gR1R0Nvhb_qQc,"Luckily I was aware of myofascial release therapy and found Ray via an online search, after being suddenly debilitated by an agonizing pain throughout the length of my right thigh, which came on after a yoga session. I went to the doctor who wasn't sure what was causing the pain, guessed it must be a pulled muscle, told me to rest it and take painkillers. However I knew that myofascial release treatment would most likely be more effective and since the practitioner I had been to before was indisposed, I booked an appointment with Ray who saw me later that very same day. At the time I couldn't walk or stand up because the pain was so excruciating and I could only sleep on a concoction of strong painkillers and sleeping medication. After my first session Ray alleviated the pain to such a degree that I no longer needed any medication. Within six days I could walk again, pain-free. Within three sessions (over 2 weeks) I was also able to stand up for long periods with no pain. In fact all the pain had disappeared.
Ray began by assessing me holistically and explaining that he could get rid of the pain no problem but it was a symptom of a bigger cause which was bad posture, which I'd had for years and needed rectifying. He explained that by manipulating myofascial tissues he could create the spaces for my muscles and bones to grow into to prevent further issues like the one I had just suffered. I am now committed to a long-term course of treatments from him to realign my body and strengthen my muscles in all the right places so that I can carry on with the rest of my life exercising regularly and not getting any injuries.
After a treatment with Ray my body needs to rest and absorb the effects. It is obvious some level of profound work has been done. I find myself far more aware of my posture and the position my body should be in. I find my body moving into the right places on its own - even in my sleep. Once my treatment is complete I will be able to do this without having to think about it and exercise safely moving forwards. I would totally recommend Ray to anyone who needs healing from physical pain. He is amazing!",5,1766047028,a month ago,en

I can honestly say that he has transformed me both physically and mentally.The work he does is truly amazing, I credit him with being the most positive influence in my life in recent years.For those who are ready to commit I couldn’t recommend him highly enough.

From the very first treatment he was able to relieve me from the stress and tightness in my shoulder that was there for almost 23 years.

Couldn’t find the iPod dock but we took one anyway. A draining board would be useful. It fits 10 people but that would be a bit of a squeeze because three beds are in the living room and due to no door to the kitchen it limits the house in the early hours for people sleeping in or wanting to get up.

ChIJe_yPI8Cxe0gRJdwELSNV_IA,"I had a very unpleasant experience at this massage place last night. I booked an 8:00 pm appointment on 13 October with Patty (one of the two masseuses shown in the online booking system) and received a confirmation email.

When I arrived about 10 minutes early, I phoned from outside the shop to check if I could come in. The staff member who answered seemed clueless and suddenly hung up on me. When I went inside, there were three staff members at the reception desk. One of them asked me rudely what I needed. I explained that I had an appointment with Patty. She looked confused, went inside to check, and came back saying Patty wasn’t in — without explaining what went wrong.

She seemed impatient and was frowning from the moment I walked in. Then, in a very unwilling tone, she said, “It’s fine, I can do it for you. You can pay now.” The way she said it made it sound as though she was doing me a favour. I told her she seemed unhappy, and another masseuse quickly tried to smooth things over by saying, “She always talks like that,” as if I should just accept her colleague’s rude behaviour.

I replied, “With that attitude, why would I want a massage now?” The rude masseuse said nothing, didn’t apologise, and still looked annoyed. I left the place in disbelief and anger.

Later, I checked their Google reviews and noticed several others had also complained about rude staff. The owner’s replies sounded serious, but clearly, the service hasn’t improved. Customers shouldn’t be treated like that. If an employee “always talks like that”, then she shouldn’t be working there.

I’m 24 and lost a lot of weight fast so I was very down about how my breasts had dropped, and this whole experience has changed my life for the better! I can not express how amazing Dr Mounir is. My breasts have healed perfect and I have had no problems with them what so ever. My scars are perfectly neat and almost invisible already and everyone has said what an amazing job he has done. The whole experience from my first consultation to this day has been faultless, even under the circumstances with the pandemic. All the girls along the way with my appointments were great too. Dr Mounir is lovely and very professional, he made me feel so comfortable and welcome and he genuinely took interest in everything I said, he listened to me and never rushed me with anything. I left all my appointments feeling very positive about my choice of surgeon. I had my operation at First trust hospital in Preston and stayed over night at the hospital. The staff were incredible, everything ran smoothly and they were constantly making sure I was okay and assisting me. Dr Mounir came to see me almost straight after I woke from my surgery to check how I was and sat and spoke with me about everything. I was discharged with everything I needed and had more than all the information I needed, I couldn’t stop smiling on my way home and could of cried with how happy I felt about how it all went. Any questions I’ve had since the operation I’ve directly asked Dr Mounir and he’s replied to me within minutes, an hour tops.. if that isn’t great care then I don’t know what is! I can not thank MYA and Dr Mounir enough for making the whole experience the best I could possibly ask for and he has certainly changed my life and confidence. Nothing I can do will express how grateful I am and if anyone is considering the same procedure as me I would totally recommend Dr Mounir. I am usually the type of person to find something wrong with everything but I can not fault Dr Mounir or my experience at all.

Positives:
Pool is great.
Sauna - is very hot great.
Staff i signed up with were fine. Although some others seemed unfriendly.
Really friendly patrons.

Negatives:
Opening hours on Friday evening and weekend are very limiting.
They hire out some of their lockers which is just a bizarre thing to do. Why?
The poolside closes at 45 minutes before closing time, what??
There is no spinner to dry wet gear and no bags provided. I askes staff where the spinner was and they replied only posh gyms have those! Ahem.. No!
The lockers in the male changing room absolutely manky. The lino is coming up in places and its very dirty. This entire area needs a serious makeover. The benches in the changing room are very uncomfortable to sit on and the area seems very humid with very little space. There seems to be no air con which is surprising as this will encourage mould given the damness and heat in this area
The hot showers are like something from the 1950s. You cant adjust the temp and they all seem to go off after about 30 seconds. This is really annoying as you have to keep pushing the button while trying to have a shower.
No seats on pool side, although there are two recliners.
There are no hot showers on poolside. They seem to have invested in a lot of cold showers because at least half the showers are cold showers. The cold showers dont go off after 30 seconds! 🤔
The steam room is really hot which is great but the seating is really uncomfortable.

ChIJ4wG9jBuxe0gRIPKIguZ0xcQ,"This was the worst experience I’ve ever had. Yesterday, I went in for my half-face laser treatment. Normally, I book this online, but that option has been removed. Instead, I booked lip and chin, which showed a 10-minute appointment. My usual half-face treatment doesn’t even take 10 minutes to complete.

Initially, I was told they couldn’t do the half-face treatment. After I explained the situation, the technician eventually agreed to proceed with the half face. However, after the treatment was completed, I was informed that I would be charged for a full-face session—even though only half of my face was treated. The justification given was that it was “more cost-effective.” While I understand that point, it should have been clearly explained before the procedure. I was only informed at the payment stage. Had I known I would be charged for a full face, I would have used the service accordingly.

On top of that, the staff’s attitude was extremely disappointing. The manager appeared visibly displeased when I came to make the payment, seemingly because I had only done half face—even though the entire procedure took less than 10 minutes. This kind of attitude is completely unacceptable.

Her technique is gentle yet incredibly effective — I noticed visible results much faster than I expected. The clinic is spotless, modern, and creates a very relaxing atmosphere. What I appreciate the most is her warm personality and the way she makes each appointment feel personal and tailored to my needs.

ChIJT8hHHAexe0gRO38j4xYmm3I,"Around 4 months ago i underwent the 10x Precision Genetic test at REVIV. The results took around 3 weeks and I arranged a consultation with Dr Michael Barnish to explain the Health and Weight loss aspect of the results. Dr Barnish was both knowledgeable professional and caring. He took his time to explain every aspect of the test. And at the end of the process I felt able to follow a comprehensive course of action to improve my health.

Although I was motivated enough to go ahead and take this test as a 64yr old relatively fit woman I was a little bit sceptical on how to improve.

Over the following 3 months I took Dr Barnish’s advice on how to follow the results in line with the recommended food types and I subscribed to the 10x supplements.

Well I have to say I am absolutely shocked, astonished and amazed!!! Better than I could have imagined …..I have far more energy and my constant lower back and shoulder pain has now gone.

If you are considering treatment with Dr. Rosh, save your money and go to a clinic that treats patients with professionalism, respect, and courtesy.

ChIJb8UbXYm8cEgReeDSgz8eN_s,"I had my haircut on 9 December. It has now been a week, and the situation has still not been resolved.

During the consultation, I asked to add soft layers at the bottom. Instead, my hair was cut unevenly with random, choppy sections starting halfway down the length. The front — which I asked not to be touched — was cut significantly shorter, and on one side around my face there is an abrupt short section that looks very bad and cannot be blended.
I spent two years growing my hair, and in one appointment it was damaged to the point that the only way to fix it now is to cut it much shorter. I now also have to spend more money at another salon to fix this than I paid for this haircut.

I was asked to return and discuss possible next steps, but I do not trust the salon to correct damage that should never have happened in the first place.

Management confirmed in writing that a refund would be issued and asked for my bank details, but despite multiple follow-ups, nothing has been done. My last two emails, sent on Friday, have received no reply at all, and no refund has been processed.

This is not a minor styling issue — it is permanent damage to hair that took years to grow. I would strongly advise others to be very cautious, especially if you care about maintaining your hair length.

ChIJb8UbXYm8cEgReeDSgz8eN_s,"UPDATE / PART 2

This is an update to my experience following my haircut on 9 December.

Since my last review, the situation has still not been resolved. Despite multiple follow-up emails, my last emails received no reply, and no refund has been issued.
I was explicitly told by the salon that a refund would be processed and was asked to provide my bank details, which I did. I provided them and then was ignored for a full week — no refund, no updates, no replies to my last emails. After waiting and getting nowhere, I left a review. A week after we called to ask what was happening and were told that the refund would no longer be issued because I left a bad review.

At this point, I am out of pocket, and I am also having to spend more money at another salon to fix the damage caused to my hair.

This has been handled extremely poorly from start to finish. What’s most shocking is not just the bad haircut, but the way this has been handled afterward — broken promises, no communication, and then retaliation for leaving an honest review.

This is not an investment that has been done lightly. I had to be sure that I will have access to spare parts etc…after the guarantee period ends.

I had questions and they have been answered promptly and professionally. I have done a mistake in my order and the sales manager put it right in a friendly and reassuring manner. Delivery was a breeze, with all the updates, tracking number, and very safely packed.
I have to say, this Chair is a piece of art! The leather feels so luxurious and soft, every seam oozing with quality, all mechanisms working smoothly and quietly. It’s just beautiful and doesn’t take much room. It does everything I need it to do and more. I am so happy! I excited to see my clients faces when they use it. It’s incredibly comfortable. Now my back is safe and I can be of service and do what I love for many years to come.
Thank you for producing such a majestic piece. It was a great experience purchasing it from you. All the best!

P.S I performed a couple of pedicures on this chair and it’s a breeze. My clients are very impressed with the level of comfort I can deliver now, thanks to this piece of equipment.

ChIJmzlwd527cEgR8lLi7sUiBL8,"Dear [Boots store /Uber Eats],

I am writing to express my outrage and deep concern regarding a serious error with my recent order placed via Uber Eats. I urgently ordered Kendamil Goat Milk First Infant Formula for my newborn baby — a critical item for her health and wellbeing. Instead, I received a completely unrelated and inappropriate delivery: paracetamol and ibuprofen.

This is not a minor mistake. It is a gross failure in duty of care, especially given that I am currently unwell and relied on this delivery to avoid leaving home. The substitution of essential infant formula with adult medication is not only negligent but potentially dangerous.

I demand the following:

• A full and immediate refund
• A formal explanation of how this error occurred
• Confirmation that corrective action will be taken to prevent this from happening to other families

I have retained all packaging and taken photographs of the incorrect items as evidence. I expect this matter to be treated with the seriousness it deserves.",1,1764093058,2 months ago,en
ChIJmzlwd527cEgR8lLi7sUiBL8,"I went to boots on 31st October, ( Bullring)  I needed a foundation, as I looked around I could not see any staff visible apart from a staff member who was stocking up.
It was very busy in boots it was roughly 18:00pm.
I thought I should test the foundation on the back of my hands and see the difference.
As I took a swatch the foundation gushed on to my off-white cream coat , Gucci scarf and coffee brown top! I was absolutely furious since I had foundation over me now!! I went to the nearest till to ask for wipes or tissue .
I seen a female staff member “safa” serving.
She smiled at me to acknowledge me while she was serving at the same time. I was huffing and puffing as it’s so busy and I have social anxiety.

As soon as she finished serving she greeted me with a hello and asked if I was ok or if I needed any help.
I explained what had  happened she said don’t worry come with me .
Not only the lovely safa took my foundation of my clothes and accessories, she also swatched the right foundation for me , served me at the same time she was telling the customers she will be right with them as soon as she has finished helping me!

It was extremely busy there was less staff as my sister was shopping and looking for cheek and lip blushers.
Safa helped my sister too, the blusher that my sister was after was sold out , safa then found an alternative which my sister purchased.

I went on to say thank you to safa and how I will approach her when I go next in to shop at boots.
Safa customer service was excellent I can say that since I have a retail background.

Boots overall had less cosmetic staff around on the makeup section but safa still didn’t fail to use her customer skills.
I have been shopping for many years in boots but the level of experience I had on the 31st October 2025 definitely needs to be acknowledged and recognised.
I’d like to thank safa one more time and she got my foundation match bang on I did tan on holiday, she gave me the perfect shade!!
Carry on with the great work safa & I hope to shop there very soon!

I had a hair transplant, the ‘office manager’ is one of the most arrogant and awful people i’ve ever met. the technicians performing the procedure barely acknowledged me, didn’t even notice when blood was dripping into my eye. i wasn’t given any notice for when it would finish and when i asked i was told by the technician she was trying her best to finish it, no time given still so when it abruptly finished i had to wait 45 minutes for a lift home with 3 very impatient looking staff staring at me telling me they couldn’t go home until i did.

no expectations set so i bought myself a neck pillow and there was one provided so that was a waste. i had to ask about what medication i should take, should i use minoxidil, the answer was ‘yes probably’

aftercare didn’t exist, when trying to contact the clinic for questions and concerns, you’re calling a switchboard, took days to get answers.

nothing about this was good, it’s very expensive and results are rubbish, so much so the surgeon said he wanted to correct it free of charge but because the office manager was so awful with communication, this never happened and the surgeon left… i think? how would i know, no one answers my queries.

This situation is particularly frustrating given that I was told there would be a confirmation call on Thursday and that my booking was secured.

ChIJEUfiZvS8cEgRqrlaFa_l1gA,"I had a pleasant visit to Amala Spa, however I was surprised to hear that treatments are not available during the week, which was slightly disappointing. Given the treatments were not running, it felt more like a health club than a spa as there are no relaxation areas, hot drinks, darker lighting, or any other amenities typically associated with the spa experience.

Saying that, the facilities included a small gym, a nice 1.68m deep pool ideal for some short lengths, a boiling hot sauna, a small steam room, a small jacuzzi, and a plunge pool (though it wasn’t particularly cold - the dedicated cold shower was much colder!). There are several beds/chairs to relax in, and the overall atmosphere is nice and calm.

The changing rooms are a decent size and offer combination lockers, but many of them were broken - it took me four attempts to find one that worked. I arrived later in the evening, and the changing area was showing signs of use throughout the day, with towels, sandals, and a left over swimming costume with bottles etc. left in the showers. One of the shower heads was also on the floor. One of the showers also didn’t get hot, so I had to switch showers to one that worked.

Overall, it’s a nice space to unwind if you’re staying in Birmingham for an event at the ICC or Rec, but it could definitely benefit from more regular upkeep throughout the day, as well as a few maintenance issues being fixed such as the lockers and the showers.

I had full leg and hollywood wax. I swear the Hollywood  wax was painless and I was done in total 4 patches.

- booking through treatwell I selected nail art, but was told I'd have to pay more when I got to the salon. When I mentioned the nail art they didnt seem confident or show me any ideas of what they could do, so I chose to just have different colours on each nail.
- the equipment looks pretty ancient and unclean, especially the buffers and files which were super worn out and unhygienic. There was a lot of nail dust in the air (which could be prevented if they had good ventilation at the tables), so there is some debris stuck to my nails (see the middle one). Not hugely obvious but its preventable.

Overall I am satisfied - I would consider going again given the good price and location.",3,1568305178,6 years ago,en

After several sessions, I've noticed a significant reduction in hair growth, especially in stubborn areas.

ChIJe_AQMqq8cEgRGcxb__7ltEI,"I was quoted £55 over the phone for a weave with closure, but ended up being charged £68. This included around £3 for parting the closure and an additional £10 because one of my tracks was cut into pieces.

I don’t mind paying extra where necessary, however I do not agree with the amount I was charged especially when the end of the tracks were pocking out and I had to then part the closure myself again because the lady was parting it on the side and saying it was in the middle.

I requested parting in the middle but the closure was placed more towards the right. This resulted in less hair on one side, making my roots visible at times, and I constantly have to cover it.

Additionally, the closure was not tightened properly, so after a few days it shifted backwards. It’s been 5days now.

From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed into a calm, clean, and beautifully professional environment. The clinic has such a relaxing atmosphere that instantly puts you at ease.

Christina is truly exceptional — kind, caring, highly knowledgeable, and incredibly professional. She took the time to explain everything in detail, made me feel comfortable throughout the treatments, and showed genuine care for my skin and results. I am currently doing laser hair removal and Hydrafacial, and I am beyond happy with the experience and the results so far.

Her attention to detail, gentle approach, and confidence made me feel I was in the best possible hands. Everything was done with such care and precision — I couldn’t ask for more.

ChIJ328hh1a8cEgRpcastiipkNE,"e aware - NEVER USE THIS ORGANISATION …
I never leave a complaint about anything as I always choose to put it down to experience, but on this occasion I am so disappointed I feel I should warn other customers!! I have added all the email I received so you can your own mind up!! However two points to consider - an organisation that holds you to terms and conditions that you never signed or agreed?? But they failed to provide me the service I paid for but no consequences for them? All I wanted was the service I requested! Over 2 months later and three chaser calls this is the response!! I am appalled! I will be taking further action - but please prevent yourself being in a similar situation.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and for affording us the opportunity to investigate the concerns raised in your complaint dated the 17th of October 2025. Following a full review of the concerns and having completed our investigation with the relevant internal teams, I hope this response provides clarity and reassurance.

Firstly, we would like to acknowledge your frustration and apologise that you feel your experience did not meet the standards we aim to deliver. It is regrettable that you felt the need to raise a complaint, but we are grateful that you did — feedback from our clients is crucial in helping us improve our service.
We understand that you raised concerns regarding your Laser Hair Removal packages for upper lip and chin that you purchased at our Edgbaston clinic on the 16th of July 2025. Our records indicate that your first treatment was scheduled for the 30th of July 2025, but unfortunately, this appointment had to be cancelled due to staffing issues. We also understand that you were expecting a call from the clinic to reschedule your appointment, which regrettably has not yet taken place.
We have since engaged with the Edgbaston Clinic Manager, Ms. Maisie Wilkins, and the team at the clinic are working diligently to ensure smooth operations for all clients. The team would like to extend their sincere apologies for the lack of communication and the handling of your previous appointment.

We fully acknowledge how frustrating this must have been, especially with the expectation of attending a clinic to receive timely and effective care. While we recognise that the scheduling inconsistencies you encountered at our Edgbaston clinic has fell short of both your expectations and our own, outlined within our Terms and Conditions we state; “pre-paid course treatments are only refundable for medical reasons which require approval of the Clinical Services Director. Any refund agreed is calculated by deducting the cost of all treatments already performed, from the total price of the course of treatment paid by the patient.”

In light of this, we must respectfully decline your request for a refund of your current package.

Whilst we have no contractual obligation to do so, as a gesture of goodwill we will provide an extension of your package of three (3) months. To confirm, the package expiration date for your Laser Hair Removal packages will now be the 16th of October 2026. Thereafter, any unused treatments will be redeemed.

While we cannot change your previous experience, we remain committed to supporting your treatment journey to a successful outcome.

Yours Sincerely,
Sk:n / The Harley Medical Group

Today was a really tough day for me — I couldn’t make it to Dublin as planned, and I lost £67 on the trip. I was feeling quite low and decided to go shopping with my husband just to clear my head a bit. We went into Boots on High Street, and that’s where I met Ms. Sue at the customer service desk.

From the very start, she was so kind and genuinely caring. She went above and beyond to help us sort out an issue with my Boots Advantage card, and she did it all with such patience, warmth, and professionalism. You could just feel how much she truly cares about people.

When she heard what a rough day I’d had, she gave me a hug, and wished me all the best — and honestly, that simple act of kindness meant so much to me. It completely lifted my spirits. In a world where everyone is rushing, meeting someone like Ms Sue — so pure-hearted, understanding, and kind — really stands out.

Also a lovely lady, really friendly fun to chat with but the haircut she gave was sort of messy since the right and left side wasn’t of the same length. It’s pretty obvious since i have short hair. Luckily, my hair grows very fast since i tend to cut my hair at least once in 2-3 months. The 3rd time I got John and i’ve been requesting for him ever since. I showed him the model picture and he follows through with a slight tweak since i wanted a fringe. Refer to the pictures attached! His skills got better and better the more i go there and on the 5th time, i have no comment at all. Just absolute perfection.

So today I went back to Christodoulous and had my hair cut by Jim who was brilliant. Made sure I was 100 percent happy when he was finished and was super friendly throughout the cut and has a great sense of humour. Will be booking in with Jim in future as he did a wonderful job at sorting my hair ready for my son's first birthday in a week, he was also able to fit my mum in at short notice despite it being a busy Saturday, thanks Jim!
Update on my original comment - Today Jim rang me to investigate what had happened and was really apologetic and lovely and offered to look after me for my next hair appointment personally, and offered a complimentary cut due to my last experience.I will update my review further after my next hair appointment but this is a lovely personal touch, showing genuine care for how people feel when they leave.

Jim is very friendly, really nice welcoming service.
It's just a shame about my actual experience having my hair cut. My stylist was very blunt, absolutely no personality or customer service present at all... It made the whole experience feel very awkward and I couldn't wait for it to be over which is a shame as after not brinyg able to have my hair cut for a while due to giving birth and having a little one I was looking forward  to a good hair cut.
I asked for a certain style to be put in (one I have had before and liked) only to be told it would look bad on me in quite a blunt way, and that I should have it cut another way, feeling pressured I did so... The cut looked adequate in store after having to get the fringe shortened quite a few times.... But upon looking in the mirror at home I can see my right side  is slightly longer than the left side and part of my fringe has been missed at the side so I will have to trim that myself..
Also, I was charged £27.95 for a dry cut, not the advertised £21.95.... not sure why to be honest. Don't think I'll be revisiting at all, will find an alternative for my next appointment.",5,1696697313,2 years ago,en

ChIJb0mj0oq8cEgRn-gXjgRdALg,"We stayed at this hotel on Saturday 17th January and had a truly fantastic experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, the reception staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly, which immediately set the tone for our stay.
Our room on the 6th floor (room 614) was spotless and beautifully presented, with an amazing view over the city. It was my wife’s birthday, and she was completely surprised by the stay — and especially impressed by how clean and tidy the room was.
My wife is a big coffee drinker, and we had gone through all the coffee in the room quite quickly. We spoke with the housekeeping maid on the 6th floor, who genuinely could not have been more helpful. She went out of her way to provide us with extra coffee and tea and was absolutely fantastic. A huge credit to the housekeeping team for the excellent standards they clearly maintain.
The bar and restaurant staff were unbelievable, and the food was amazing — both the service and quality were spot on.

I booked a 30-minute private massage, paid the normal rate at reception and picked one of the ladies from the line-up.

Unfortunately it was a really bad experience. The lady seemed to be in a huge hurry from the second we went into the room. The back massage lasted literally 2 minutes and was very mechanical. When I turned over she spent even less time, then suddenly said the session was over and told me to get dressed – even though only about 4 minutes had passed in total.

I politely said I had paid for 30 minutes and still had plenty of time left. She just laughed, said something like “you’re done now” and told me to leave. I ended up walking out after less than 10 minutes. Felt completely cheated and embarrassed.

For a first-time visitor this was shocking. I won’t be going back and I can’t recommend it to anyone else. Plenty of other places in Birmingham that actually give you the time you pay for.

I underwent microneedling for stretch marks after being assured they had experience treating brown skin and shown results claiming up to 90% improvement. I paid £700 per session, trusting their expertise. The procedure was unbearably painful, and throughout the treatment the practitioner showed little care, empathy, or support while I was clearly in distress. I was also made to feel extremely uncomfortable due to a complete lack of privacy when changing.

What’s worse is that the hyperpigmentation caused by the treatment never healed. Instead, it left permanent-looking scars. I spent a significant portion of my savings hoping to fix an existing skin concern, only for it to be made far worse due to what felt like negligence and poor aftercare. This experience has been emotionally and physically distressing.

When we arrived the receptionist offered for us to upgrade our massage to deep tissue and add more time for a fair price so I did that and I was happy with that. The atmosphere and decor is not luxurious but is pleasant nonetheless. I really enjoyed my massage I think the masseuse's name was January? If I heard correctly. She did a lovely massage one of the best I've had great deep pressure. I would say it should be more clear where to get food from, but that wasn't a problem for us as we brought sandwiches with us. There was a hot drink machine which was nice. I enjoyed the gym there was a great boxing area there good for releasing rage but I did have to ask about where the boxing gloves were as they were in a different room. The relaxation lounge was lovely the water beds were nice and comfy I could have had a nap!   It would have been good for the receptionist to state the different facilities at the start of the spa day so we were informed of all the areas, however it was OK because we went on a mooch around the place and found our own way around. In general it was a clean and tidy place I would say the bathroom sinks need a bit more cleaning around the rims and the changing room floors and walls need a little more attention but in general it was clean enough. It was a bit hard to find the showers after using the spa as they just look like changing rooms someone had to show us. So be aware of that. We didn't go in the pool as it wasn't warm enough but that might be influenced because we were warm from the steam room and hot tub. We enjoyed the hot tub bubbles although sometimes the bubbles took a while to come on. The steam room was very good for working as a decongestant and good for asthmatic cough and chestiness clearing the chest afterwards. Very hot in there could only do 5 minutes at a time. There was only 2 elemis testers on display which was a downfall. My friend and I were disappointed because when we opened them they were Completely empty and no sign that there was cream in them it was completely clean. We mentioned this to the receptionist who said we should have said something earlier as they are supposed to have cream in them. But didn't explain why they were empty so I am still baffled as to why they were empty. As I was very excited to do testers so I was disappointed. But other than that we did have a lovely day and a relaxing day. The highlights were the massage, the gym, the relaxation lounge room and the steam room. All in all a nice place and had a lovely day.

Been going to the spa over 20 years since it opended intermittently but it has become very, very toxic since the pandemic reopening. They never answer their phone and always make excuses when trying to get through to book an appointment. Had some wonderful facials with some lovely therapists (Skye) and (Freya) over the recent years. Despite having numerous treatments booked by the spa manager herself (Luci Tovey), she is resorting to banning customers for making legitimate customer service complaints. Paid £50 for gel nails, one nail fell off within  7 days. Luci Tovey was not happy and bullied/victimised me as the customer. There was no apology and photographic evidence showed my nail had completely fallen off. Not what you would expect from what they claim is the 'best spa in the city'. Instead of an apology and fixing it, Luci Tovey arranged to ban (victimise) me as a customer so she comes across as running a good spa where they have no complaints. The nail was fixed after complaints were made but the poor original member of staff (Skye) went on sick leave on the actual morning. I am concerned Luci Tovey is bullying the spa staff the same way she arranged for me to be banned (victimising customers) for making a genuine service complaint. Please do not visit this spa - they have turned into toxic poision and are self-serving rather than customer serving. They will also make false accusations against customers (which they cannot support) to justify their own toxic practices. AVOID! This will soon die it's death.

ChIJS6uq6sS9cEgRRcmDXz6bihI,"Had some treatments done by Irina and Viktoria. Firstly the clinic is very clean, girls are always using gloves when touching your face and always show you the packaging, the product it self and expiry date on it. Irina is not only very knowledgeable and skilled, but also quite honest about what you should or shouldn’t do,she will not perform a treatment if she thinks it’s not necessary or not suitable for you. Products she uses are the top of the range and combined with her techniques  allow you to have the best results ever. I was very hesitant of having my lips done, as I was afraid to have “duck lips”, but guess what , Irina just nailed it- now my lips are more defined, plumped but still very natural. Can’t be happier!

I got to the salon at 6pm to find my appointment was cancelled and she had booked someone else in?! How unprofessional and a total cowboy job?!

Dr Saher was talking about my cousin with her colleague in front of us, making rude facial expressions and hand gestures indicidating why its taking so long for my cousin to fill out the bunch of forms given to her. Dr Saher then without even asking my cousin, assumed that my cousin did not speak English and had told her colleague to translate. Clearly the Dr struggled to speak in English herself and preferred a customer that would speak urdu to make her life easier.  My cousin was very upset with the Dr's behaviour towards her.

From my very first session, I noticed a huge difference in hair reduction on both my body and face, and the results have continued to improve with each session.
Parv has been absolutely amazing throughout my treatment journey. She is professional, knowledgeable, and makes you feel completely at ease. Her expertise truly shows in the results — only a few sessions in, and I am already miles away from having to shave, which was a major concern for me as I used to shave every other day.
My experience here has been especially positive compared to a previous clinic I attended, where I had 8 sessions for my face and neck with very minimal results. I was then advised to pay for an additional 6 sessions, which I did, yet still saw no real improvement and eventually stopped attending. The difference with MY Skin Boutique has been night and day — real, visible progress from the start.

ChIJK3ihO8y9cEgRcGk99_w-Sik,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful experience at The Mansion Spa in Birmingham. We originally wanted to book a couples Thai massage, but the therapist who offers this was unavailable. However, the receptionist was incredibly helpful and suggested the closest alternative—a sports massage for me and a foot massage for my husband—which turned out to be a fantastic choice.

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and made to feel completely at ease. We were both placed in the same spacious room, which had a calming, relaxing ambience with soft lighting—perfect for unwinding together.

The massage itself was exceptional. I had injured my back a few weeks prior, and after reassuring my masseuse that nothing was broken or nerve-related (I’d had an MRI), she focused carefully and expertly on the problem area. It was a full-body massage, and my therapist, Christina, was absolutely amazing—attentive, professional, and very intuitive. She regularly checked that the pressure was comfortable and adjusted it when needed, which made me feel completely cared for.

This was honestly one of the best massage experiences I’ve ever had. My body feels incredible, my pain has noticeably reduced, and my neck and shoulders feel unbelievably light. I would 100% recommend The Mansion Spa and will definitely be returning—10/10 experience!",5,1766950667,a month ago,en

ChIJxarqQfW8cEgRp0UoyQ6uIrY,"Finally the search for a clinic that is using high quality injectables with an expert practitioner has been realised.  I’ve been using Botox for about 18 years and was always happy to have my injections right here in Birmingham, that is until about ten years ago when I began to find myself continually disappointed by the results.  I went from clinic to clinic trying to recapture the results I’d come to expect in years gone by,  but sadly the results continued to disappoint. When I discussed this at my follow up appointment, I was often told things I believed not to be accurate such as “ Botox is less effective as you get older “ or “ it’s because you are over using Botox “,  a simple search on google will tell you that the excuses I was given as to why my treatment was disappointing was not accurate. In the end if I wanted an effective treatment, I would have to travel to Manchester or London, it would appear that Botox still worked outside of the Midlands. The good news is, all this was until I discovered Dermoperfection.  I can’t tell you how happy I was to stumble across this Clinic when I was with a few friends at the Mailbox.  I decided to give it a try and I couldn’t be happier that I did. The results are always great, I am no longer disappointed and I no longer have to travel to Manchester or London to get the high quality results I want.

She was very thorough and weighed out the procedure with the ideal outcomes and possible risks. She explained this well and was very confident in doing so, which is very reassuring as a customer. I just wanted treatment for a scar on my eye area and she focused on how we would treat this, additionally she went into concise detail that it was a small area and for the same cost she'll also be able to treat the smile lines around my eyes, along with the scar. I thought this was very meticulous, thoughtful and complimentary with what I wanted done. I could see customers being really happy with this so I thought to mention it, but I am very happy that I can just get the scar treated. Exemplary work.

Also, the clinic was very clean and tidy and the girls on the front desk was wonderful too, who I'm sure were the girls who offered the superb helpful communication and customer service via WhatsApp and phone call conversations prior to the appointment (I know that one of the girls who did this was called Charlotte.

She advised services according to my needs and prioritised that above profit even.

He came to my home with his mobile service, and I started the session feeling completely tense from training and old injuries – by the end I felt lighter, looser, and fully recharged. He even left me with tailored aftercare – including pictures and diagrams of stretches – so I can keep improving between sessions. His knowledge, technique, and genuine care made all the difference.

Two other staff ignored me even after I made eye contact, and the one who finally helped did so reluctantly, looking unhappy about it.
This made me wonder whether this behaviour was general poor service or discrimination because of my hijab. It’s very different from what I usually experience in stores like John Lewis, where staff are consistently polite and welcoming.

1. the shop is never stocked and its impossible to shop because the workers just start restocking while you’re looking at products and get in your way, keep in mind this is a store thats almost always busy.
2. workers are very rude and make you feel like an inconvenience, if you ask them where anything is or if they have an item in stock they either ignore you or just tell you to check.
3. the workers do ANYTHING but their job - for example i was at the shop today and the cashier was on call with someone and kept ignoring me when i told her i had a health and beauty card! she also ignored me when i greeted her as i walked up to the counter and when i asked for a bag she just looked in the direction of the bags in the self checkout area and and turned around (gave me her back) to continue talking on the phone.
4. This is the closest superdrug to my house so i have been there a lot but there were a couple times where the security and workers would chase me around the whole place while im shopping and obnoxiously talk to eachother about “keeping an eye” on me. they do this to almost every customer that walks in, and i’ve noticed it’s even worse if that customer is a person of color, i’ve overheard the workers and security say many inappropriate and unacceptable things.

While at the checkout, I did not understand a promotion that was being applied, so I politely asked a female staff member for assistance. Unfortunately, I did not note her name, but she was of short stature and had dark hair.

When I politely asked her to come over to help me, she rolled her eyes and approached me in a visibly irritated manner. I calmly asked her to remain calm, as nothing serious was happening. At that point, she attempted to raise her voice; I immediately stopped the conversation from escalating further. However, her dismissive and tense attitude made it increasingly difficult for me to understand her explanation, which caused unnecessary confusion and tension.

Eventually, I understood the promotion, thanked her politely for her time, and the interaction ended. She then walked away still visibly annoyed, leaving me with a strange and uncomfortable feeling after what should have been a simple customer service interaction.

The beauty parlours are in pristine condition, they offer a 5 star, luxurious service, the treatments are highly effective and you leave feeling like a million bucks.

ChIJ4SNtrp5GiEgRH3L2j6szQek,"The girls are nice enough but the reasonings as to why I won’t be back are as follows-
Inconsistent service- first time I went for consultation girl done both armpits as I have a bunch of stragglers
and fine hairs from laser/waxing. Noticed in the shower that only the noticeable black hairs were gone so I wouldn’t say job finished as she put it. She also underestimated how long it would take for the next appointment as it took the next girl the full hour to do both armpits and she used more pulses or currents and even then she still said there were some fine hairs.
The set up is also horrible, not at all friendly for those getting electrolysis in areas which would take longer to cover. Feel like the bed should be in the middle of the room as I did notice it does have wheels.

The room where I had my wax treatment wasn't very clean and the ancient waxing rollers were very dirty and unhygienic. I know I should have said something but it was one of those things where it had already begun and regrettably it was too late to walk out.
While waxing the lady knowing my skin was fragile and sensitive waxed my arm so hard and roughly that I now have a very black and blue bruise up my arm . She was very apologetic and I understand these things happen but even after all this, I wasn't offered a free treatment or a discount on the price paid.
Most places out of courtesy would let one of the treatments be free as a gesture of goodwill.
Really disappointed as I thought I had found my go-to place.
A peice of criticism would be to be more gentle when waxing. The skin is very sensitive so you should be trained om how to deal with different skin types. I've had waxing done in many places and by far this has been my worst experience till date.",1,1556131936,6 years ago,en

ChIJA4_93Z1GiEgRdHMCq-xOXNs,"I selected this salon based on the reviews, having had many mediocre pedicures so the Supreme Pedicure sounded like just what my feet needed. I was warmly greeted on arrival and settled in for what I thought would be a feet treat before my holiday. However, the therapist broke the skin on the side of my foot and little toe with her rough filing and later cut the cuticle on my toe. She had the audacity to suggest that I needed to see a chiropodist and took no action to disinfect the broken skin. The pedicure was far from supreme with rough edges and skin left around the nails and the polish was uneven and poorly applied. I politely pointed out the areas around the nails that I would expect to be clean and tidy on any basic pedicure and the therapist continually told me there was a limit to what she could do, she was in fact satisfied with her work and expected me to pay and leave. I offered another opportunity for a positive resolution but got nowhere. Luckily Kinka stepped in and took me downstairs for a chat and a look at the pedicure and then kindly offered to fix everything if I was able to return in a hour. I am grateful for Kinka's pedicure and would recommend you request a senior staff member for your treatment or select a named therapist from a friend or the recommendations. This was far from the experience I had been looking forward to.

There are 2 treatment chairs beside the reception and shopping area - perhaps my expectations were too high but I expected a treatment room or private area.
My feet were roughly filed with a basic foot file followed by a foot scrub, a bowl of water was brought over for me to soak my feet in. The therapist did offer me coffee etc before she left me but I wasn’t there for coffee I was there for a pampering relaxing pedicure. When she returned my nails were cut and skin buffed around my toes but not to the standard I have had elsewhere. Nails uneven and rough skin left around my toes. I had asked when I arrived if, instead of having polish I could have a longer massage which the therapist agreed to. I have no idea how long the massage should be but it was quick.

I was told I wasn't getting what I actually wanted because of the time allocation I was given by Nora my nail technician...prior to my appointment one of my nails broke but there was no attempt to find a happy medium with the length of nail...there was an atmosphere of my nail technician not being able to speak freely in-front if certain coworkers (managers possibly).

Our recent stay at the Kimpton Hotel in Glasgow was nothing short of outstanding.

As a disabled traveller, I’ve stayed in many hotels over the years all over the world, but it’s incredibly rare to find one that gets accessibility so right.

The facilities here were far above expectations everything was thoughtfully designed, genuinely accessible, and clearly put together with care and understanding rather than as an afterthought.

From the moment we arrived, the staff were warm, welcoming, and incredibly attentive, ensuring that every detail of our stay was comfortable and seamless. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed, and their friendly, professional attitude made us feel completely at ease.

The accessible room itself was superb spacious, comfortable, and beautifully finished. The bathroom was exceptionally well equipped, with all the right adaptations that actually make a difference day to day.

It’s clear that Kimpton Glasgow truly values inclusion and takes pride in offering a first-class experience for all guests.

Breakfast was another highlight a lovely, relaxed atmosphere with delicious food and plenty of options. The service once again was flawless.

It’s rare to find a hotel that strikes the perfect balance between luxury, comfort, and genuine accessibility. Kimpton Glasgow sets a new standard that many other hotels could learn from.

Can certainly see why it’s called a guest house rather than a hotel. Lovely furniture throughout and comfortable amenities, though not quite spectacular. The breakfast was a very nice touch and we were really very happy with what was offered. The area was a bit sleepy, though there are some nice restaurants and bars nearby. It couldn’t be more convenient for getting to Kelvingrove gallery.  I’d say the price seemed fair for what we received.",4,1766663525,a month ago,en
ChIJd8xjf9RFiEgRu6twlU-Lxdw,"At first arriving at the Alamo we were a bit disappointed by how small the room was. We had gone for the most affordably priced room as the price range is high. The room was conveniently labeled 'intimate' on the brochure and website, we felt that the online presentation of the Alamo on the website gives the guest house a more luxury feel than what it is in reality. It was explained that the bathroom was outside of the room when we booked online which we did not mind much when staying, they provided lovely robes and the bathroom itself was nice with a deep bath. The woman who greeted us was super friendly but we did find it slightly unprofessional that she was wearing socks and it made it have an almost hostel like vibe. What was a bit disappointing was the breakfast, it came out undercooked and cold. It also took them an hour to bring it out and it appeared the staff were flustered and underprepared. We were the only ones in the breakfast room at the time so it really shouldn't have been that much of an undertaking to cook two breakfasts. We left feeling hungry and disappointed. However the staff member who served us apologised and offered complimentary cream tea to make up for it which we appreciated. I would still recommend staying here as I feel the breakfast was perhaps due to some fault in the kitchen and it seems we were just unfortunate in our experience. Overall we had an enjoyable stay and the room was cosy, quiet and comfortable. I would definitely stay again and was happy we had chosen the guest house.

ChIJd8xjf9RFiEgRu6twlU-Lxdw,"We stayed at Alamo Guest House and had mixed feelings. The location and the historic house have potential, but for the price (about £250 per night), we expected more.

On the downside: you need to ring to get in, and there are only stairs to both entrance and rooms. Breakfast has to be reserved for a fixed time, which feels a bit restrictive. We unfortunately had a 24-hour flight delay and, although the booking was non-refundable, we provided proof of the cancellation. A goodwill gesture (like refunding the missed breakfasts) would have been appreciated, but nothing was offered. The rooms are carpeted throughout – which is a matter of taste – and we ended up in a basement room. While no “park view” was advertised, a basement wasn’t what we expected for this price. No bathrobe was provided, which would have been useful given the shared bathroom. The toilet flushed poorly (needing long, hard pressing of the button). Coffee at breakfast was very disappointing (just French press and not tasty). Overall, it felt expensive for what you get.

On the positive side: the young woman at check-in and check-out was very friendly, as was the breakfast staff. The beds weren’t very large, but we slept well. Even from the basement, we had a partial view of trees. The bathroom was pleasantly warm, and the à la carte breakfast itself was tasty.",3,1759079799,4 months ago,en

ChIJ9aMVmZhGiEgRznbRR5cyDlk,"The review is reflecting on the business, not the people who visited! First of all, we have travelled 4.5 hrs to see and experience something 'new'. The building from outside looks scary, but inside I would say 'immaculate' clean, and regarding the other similar places up to date, modern. Large bar, where they are serving alcohol (normally other places don't!), beverages and soft drink and also food! Free WiFi, condoms, lubes. Heated smoking area. 3 storeys, with the playrooms on 2 (basement and top floor). Definitely you need a lot of walk... Mostly mature people visited the sauna, and some younger students. The visitors were all very friendly - had a lot of chat with them 🙂 - it is very unusual in other saunas that people have a conversation, they're only there for fun. The guys were from all nationwide, also from Italy, Poland, Hungary, France, US...
All the experiences in this places start from the front door... Staff - I wouldn't say rude- is very simple, they could only manage a yes or know answer whatever we tried to ask. Were absolutely not bothered with people. That's pretty shocking. Normally staff in other places are buzzing around the guests to make sure they're OK, comfortable and having a grant time of their visits. I have read in other comments about this fact already so I'm just wondering why the management kick them out and employ people who loves their jobs and brings more fun and experience to their guests and also more guys to visit the place. When the guy behind the counter rolling his eyes just because I've asked where to leave the locker keys before we left, that's pretty mind-blowing.
The place has a great location, in the heart of the city centre, and for those who might travel by car, there's a huge Q-Park around the corner (safe and tidy) with a charge of £20 for 24 hours. Though after 12 hrs of stay you have to pay the full day! It is worth because while you are in the sauna your car is safe...

The ladies changing rooms are clean enough (cleaners do a fantastic job) but the stench that comes from the drains is unbearable. It absolutely stinks.

My issue is with whoever is in charge of the swimming lessons behind the scenes. There is absolutely no communication to the members and this would be fine but this also extends when classes are cancelled. Members are not notified when classes are cancelled and are only aware when they turn up for the supposed class. This happened once or twice back in Nov/ Dec. They say if they cancel a lesson before their defined cutoff date, your next Direct Debit bill will be adjusted to reflect this. I’m assuming this would be reflected by a refund or additional class(es) to make up for the loss. Unfortunately, this was not the case and again, there was no communication about this. Members need to give a month’s notice if they want to cancel their lessons (double standards) but good luck trying to get a quick reply. They do not pause your membership or hold payment regardless of circumstances. You will continue paying even if you are away for that entire month. For how expensive the lessons are, you would hope they would be a little more accommodating.

As other posts have mentioned, the jacuzzi pool is cold and not warm. The pool water can be dirty sometimes and some areas in the pool are slippery which is honestly concerning due to H&S.

Key training equipment (with no alternative for the muscle group) is left broken for almost 5 months. If you’re working with a legitimate professional trainer (not the Village staff) they’ll be struggling to adjust your plan. Critical machines are consistently out of order. Staff simply blame Technogym (the equipment manufacturer and take zero responsibility). The machines are old, dated and very tired and worn as I’ve used Technogym equipment in other gyms and it’s significantly better and way more modern. Village have clearly been going cheap on the equipment and maint contract. No supervision. Amateur gym users handling the machines stupidly and violently, inevitably contributing to the constant break downs. There’s so much plate slamming. It’s frustrating when Village PT staff are in and walking around but they don’t intervene with these people. They just leave everyone to their thing and ignore the basics. Paper Towels and cleaning Spray after often not restocked. The changing rooms, lockers and toilets are not open at 5am when the gym opens. This is because it gives access to the pool which isn’t open at that time. Still a pain for gym goers when it’s already failing to be open 24 hours. They are also filthy when they are open so I’ll do pretty much anything I can to avoid them. Sadly, the stairway to the gym smells like a sewer by 6am+ as there’s no ventilation there and too many sweaty patrons using the mini lockers at the bottom . I’ve complained to staff, management and even Village HQ about the broken key equipment for over 4 months and no changed or adjustments are made. There’s a pretence of care in their emails but this hasn’t let to anything being fixed. Overall, this place is dressed up and presented as a premium quality gym, and the price is really high but my partner and I will be cancelling our membership shortly as nothing could be further from the truth. Oh yeah, they also want 3 months notice after the full year. They’ll happily take your money but they really couldn’t care less about the actual gym.

ChIJTfAqCCdEiEgRyRWIu_lBcyk,"On reflection, I left feeling really disappointed with my experience here. For the price and expectations, I genuinely thought the facilities would be in proper working order, but that wasn’t the case at all. The reason for my review is that currently I wouldn’t recommend spending your money here until significant improvements are made.

There were multiple issues throughout my visit. The whirlpool wasn’t working, no lights and water only coming from the centre. The snow room was completely out of order. Walls in the main pool area looked dirty or cracked, which took away from what should’ve been a relaxing environment. The big sauna and steam room were both far from hot enough but that could be personal preference, and the heated beds in the dark room didn’t work at all. The only space functioning as intended was the small sauna, which was disappointing considering the range of facilities advertised.

Even the basics were rather poor, the shower doors didn’t close properly, and there wasn’t anywhere to put personal items such as own shampoo, conditioner etc. inside.

Overall, nothing was communicated about certain facilities not working, the facilities weren’t maintained, and the experience fell far short of what I expected from a spa. I really hope management takes these issues seriously so future guests don’t leave feeling the same way.",1,1765113381,2 months ago,en
ChIJTfAqCCdEiEgRyRWIu_lBcyk,"I recently visited the spa for the first time, and overall, it was a worthwhile experience. The reception staff were very friendly and accommodating, and the facility was clean with a good variety of options. However, there were a few issues that marred the experience.

First, the jacuzzi jets kept turning off without any way to switch them back on, which was annoying as I was trying to relax. Additionally, the fountains in the pool were not functioning, and the window in the main sauna was quite dirty. While the spa itself wasn't overly crowded, there was a grown adult screaming for no reason, which was quite frustrating . It would have been helpful if a staff member had reminded guests to be more considerate of others.

Despite these issues, I still enjoyed my time at the spa and hope they can address these concerns in the future.",3,1730458357,a year ago,en
ChIJTfAqCCdEiEgRyRWIu_lBcyk,"Oh, this place is absolutely amazing.  The spa is incredible with so many different spaces with different health benefits. My favourites were the lemongrass steam room and the snow room!! There were two different sized, extremely hot saunas, a salt room and a tepidarium. There was a pool with string different jets and a dark pool at the end with a surprise!!! That dark pool needs a railing! Just incredible. Loved the whole experience. We had room service and breakfast both of which were delicious and the staff were so accommodating, helpful and friendly. All in all, it was an amazing experience. Can't wait to come back.

The shower heads in the spa and jets in the pool were all rusted and dirty looking, the shower doors did not close, the snow spa was broken and pouring out water rather than snow (I had been particularly looking forward to the snow spa).

I often worry that the pressure won’t be strong enough, but that wasn’t an issue here. In fact, two areas of muscle tension were quite painful and needed less pressure – impressively, the therapist picked up on this without me having to say a word, responding intuitively to my reactions, my muscles repaonses and adjusting accordingly.

I would just like to say I visited Flavia’s on 5 December  2025 and have been there a few times before I have used lots of different beauty companies for years and years and I will honestly say this lady is 100 per cent professional in every way Aldo the salon is immaculate clean and when you enter you feel right away your going to be treated with respect and not just after your money.
It’s very upsetting when people try there best and who are doing everything right there is always dishonest  not nice people who want to try and destroy someone’s livelihood

ChIJubK5aGZFiEgRN8rNUsz5Ikg,"I honestly can’t believe how bad my experience was at
SB COSMETICS CLINIC. I was really excited to try a new beauty salon with such high ratings, but now I regret it completely. I went in for a facial treatment and mentioned several times that I have sensitive skin, but it was clear that my concerns were either ignored or not taken seriously. The staff was not thorough in assessing my skin type or discussing the products being used on my face. They seemed in such a hurry to get through the treatment that they didn’t care to address my needs.

The results were devastating. My skin started reacting immediately after the treatment, with redness, irritation, and visible breakouts that I’ve never had before. The next day, my face felt dry, tight, and even more sensitive. I had to cancel my plans because I didn’t feel comfortable leaving the house looking like that. It’s incredibly frustrating because I trusted them to use professional products and techniques, but instead, they left me with damaged skin and no apology or remedy.

To make matters worse, the staff didn’t follow up with me after the treatment to check on how my skin was doing. There was absolutely no aftercare or advice offered, which only added to my frustration. I tried reaching out to them, but the response was cold and unhelpful. It felt like they were more concerned about getting the money than ensuring their customers were actually satisfied and cared for.

I wouldn’t trust this place with my skin again, and I highly recommend people with sensitive skin to stay away. I’m now left with the consequences of their poor service, and I’ve had to spend extra time and money at another salon to fix the damage done here. The glowing reviews don’t reflect the reality of my experience at all, and I feel misled.

Avoid at all costs if you care about your skin health.",1,1764861949,2 months ago,en

Beautiful salon, reception and welcome lovely.

Karen, my skin therapist was fabulous. As she  explained, my best option was a non-invasive, full face and neck treatment, spread over 3 to 6 months.
I was slightly nervous before treatment, but was delighted at minimal discomfort- nothing much for GenX.
Anyway, I’m posting this just one week from first of three treatments (over 3 months) and I can actually see beginning and feel a plumping and tightening of my face/neck.
Not cheap (£1800-£3500)- but much nicer than £6000-£10000 for unnecessary ‘under knife’ surgery.

The massage itself definitely deserves 5 starts, however I won’t be coming back as I don’t even know the name of my masseuse- they never introduced themselves , nor did they welcome me,  say goodbye or asked if the pressure is OK during the procedure etc. The ending of the massage was a bit awkward too- the person  said something very quietly and then left the room. I thought we are done so I started putting my clothes on, only to find them come back (after good few mins) with a bowl of water to wash off the oil of my body. At this point, I was ready to go so just paid and left the room but the whole interaction was a bit odd with no more than 2-3 sentences exchanged.
Now, I was there for a massage not to chat but right at the beginning I did highlight that this is my very first time in this establishment. And I’m afraid I did not feel welcomed at all. I have no issues with minimal interactions as long as I’m informed  upfront that the person is an introvert, on a spectrum or just shy.

ChIJAcaSiEVBiEgRtICkgkgcb58,"The 1 star is only as I cannot give 0 stars. Never in all the years going to salons have I ever been treated so despicably by a therapist or in this case a part business owner and never have I had the need to give a bad review.
I Purchased a groupon  voucher for eyebrow micro blading, made my first appointment and the therapist Nanda did not show up to the salon, apparently it was her day off but did not inform me. I left and made a 2nd appointment, this was then cancelled by Nanda as she was unwell. My 3rd appointment was also cancelled due to Nanda again being unwell. On my 4th appointment, I arrived at the salon only to be told that again Nanda was not in and did not think she was coming back to the salon. (I now know they rented space in the salon) After several calls where the girls in the salon were very helpful, Nanda called me with lies saying she did not have my number to let me know she no longer worked there and was renting at another salon in town. Even after all of this I agreed to walk up to the Gallowgate to finally get my treatment. On arrival she apologised for all the confusion over the previous 4 wks.......!!! Finally, after numbing cream for over half an hour, I had my treatment done. During this I was so embarrassed as she told me the salon owner who did my brows before was not good at her job, my brows were a mess and she had fixed all of her clients eyebrows....!!! Nanda then told me that to get this treatment, I had to pay a deposit of £50 to return for a top up which I agreed to, however, did not tell me that it would be another £150 on top of the £50 plus the  £89 voucher to have this done. I felt I had no choice but to agree or I would have lost the voucher and £50. My brows were a nice shape when I left but the tint she uses had faded by half in the middle of the brows within 2 weeks.
Again, left without much choice I made an appt to return to have them topped up as they did not look good at all, very patchy.
New appointment was made and on this occasion I had to cancel due to bad news, I tried to re-book and was told no appointments and since then she did not answer my txts or the answer the phone. Then I received a txt saying I didn't give 24hrs notice. My friend had a bad diagnosis that morning and I asked Nanda to have a bit of compassion, especially since I did not complain once for all the occasions she let me down. No reply at all. Basically this woman has no care or compassion for her clients and as far as I'm concerned, stole my money and got away with it.
I apologise for the lengthy review but in this case, it is 100% warranted as this woman is basically a thief and a very unreliable therapist I would never want anyone else to have to deal with.

ChIJHUMUph5ceUgRigXyRrVkwa8,"I am extremely disappointed with the level of customer service I received in Boots. I approached a member of staff with a simple, reasonable question about a product on the shop floor. Instead of receiving help, I was spoken to in a rude, dismissive, and completely unprofessional manner.

The worker responded by saying, “It’s not for you to know as it’s so close to Christmas so we don’t use them,” which is an unacceptable way to speak to a customer. No explanation, no attempt to help, just a blunt and condescending comment. To make matters worse, they then walked away without giving me any opportunity to respond or ask further questions. I was left standing there feeling embarrassed and brushed off, as if my presence was an inconvenience.

There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour. Being busy, especially near Christmas, does not justify rudeness or a lack of basic customer service. Boots is a well-known, trusted retailer, and I expect staff to be knowledgeable, polite, and willing to help customers — not dismiss them with attitude and walk away.

This experience has genuinely put me off shopping here again. If this is the standard of customer service being allowed, then it seriously needs addressing.

The nail technician, whilst working on another person then asked me to put my nails in the soaking bowl.  After a while, I asked how long it was going to be and said that I wasn't happy about putting my fingers in solvent which were now turning white at this point.  She replied that this was their usual removal technique and she would scrape off the polish. It's not a technique I've ever experienced before, it seems to be a means of getting as many customers through as possible.  Before she continued with the polish she took the money for the removal, it's usual for payment to be taken after a decent service has been provided, not before, they have obviously had complaints and refusals to pay.

Why bother with cuticle tidying up when you can simply paint over them!  Although the polish was a nice colour it wasn't Shellac, which I had been misled to believe it would be on the voucher.

Needless to say, I won't be returning and will be complianing to Groupon about the misleading sale of Shellac.

Victoria was an absolute dream. She was warm, friendly, and refreshingly honest. She guided me with such expertise, making sure I didn’t overdo the filler and helping me choose exactly what would look best with my natural lip shape. Her precision and eye for detail are incredible, and my lips have never looked better. I’m obsessed with the result!

The aftercare was just as impressive. I had minimal bruising, and Victoria’s communication was amazing.

ChIJCzYkiRlceUgRDGtwSOYNSFU,"I am extremely disappointed with the service I have consistently received at New York Nails, despite being a loyal customer for a long time. Unfortunately, I have experienced ongoing issues with almost every nail technician at this salon, with the exception of Tina and a young lady who wears glasses. The other technicians have repeatedly been disrespectful, including speaking about me in their own language while I am sitting there. On several occasions, I have recorded these conversations and had them translated, only to hear unpleasant and inappropriate comments being made about me. This behaviour is completely unacceptable.

In addition to this, my nails and toes have frequently been done poorly. My nails have been filed unevenly, and when I have raised concerns, I have been told that my nails are naturally wonky, which is not true, as I have had my nails done professionally elsewhere without any issues. On another occasion, my toes were painted very poorly, not close to the cuticle, unevenly, and in a way that made them look inflamed. Instead of correcting the issue, the technicians became defensive and again began speaking about me in their language.

Today I experienced a similar situation. I politely explained that I was unhappy because my toes were not painted to the cuticle and had been filed unevenly. The technician immediately began speaking about me to other staff members and told me she would remove the nails but refused to redo them. I explained that I was already late for work and even showed her the time on my phone, yet there was no understanding or consideration. I then offered to still pay for the service and simply asked if two to three pounds could be taken off due to the poor quality. This was refused until I spoke directly to Tina, who resolved the issue.

As I was leaving, I was told that I should not come back because the technician is leaving, or that there would be no one willing to do my nails. This was extremely upsetting and unprofessional. Overall, I have had problems with nearly every technician at this salon. Whenever I raise valid concerns about the quality of my nails, I am made to feel as though I am the problem or that I am exaggerating, which is not the case. I will be providing photos to clearly show the poor workmanship. This is not how a loyal customer should ever be treated, and the level of customer service I have experienced is unacceptable.",1,1765909379,a month ago,en

Reached out to the salon via Facebook no reply. Nails wasn’t applied straight which even she noticed. I started experiencing pain and my partner removed one, she has applied so much pressure my real nails are growing into my skin.

After she clipped them and I said I want them shorter she looked at me angry. I remained very polite and said thank you once she had done the shape. Once they was painted I asked for ten diamonds on each of my wedding fingers and when she asked where do I wasn't them on the nail I just replied no particular order just all over. She then filled my whole nail with chunky diamonds, literally like 20 and after I explained I only wanted ten she had a full blown argument with me. I tried helping her suggesting she took the bottom and sides ones off and she got my whole finger pulled all the diamonds off as they hadn't set and started talking in her language very frustrated.

ChIJceX_QylceUgRJ_BuC0nj6Ow,"I had a very disappointing experience at this salon. I first called ahead to ask if I needed to book an appointment, and the owner said I could just walk in. I arrived less than 10 minutes later by Uber.

When I got there, I politely asked how much it would cost to do cornrows (without attachment). She looked at my hair, didn’t respond right away, and after about a minute, she said it would be £25. I was a bit surprised by the price, so I calmly asked if it would be okay to pay £20 instead. She said no, and that’s completely fine, it’s her business and her price.

However, instead of leaving it at that, she became rude and angry. I explained that this was my first time ever going to a salon on Dewsbury Road to make my hair, and that I usually use home services that charge around the same amount. That’s when she suddenly snapped and started raising her voice, telling me I should “use common sense,” and going off about how shop prices include rent and electricity.

At no point was I rude. I came in calmly, asked a genuine question, and simply tried to negotiate respectfully. I didn’t argue or push. Her reaction was completely uncalled for.

If you’re looking for professionalism or basic customer service, I would think twice. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, especially when they’ve done nothing wrong. The owner seriously needs to work on her communication and anger management.",1,1750937266,7 months ago,en

She was sat doing braids for me for over 7 hours (she plaits slowly) and plays gospel music really loudly, which I found too loud and overstimulating. I don’t mind her listening to the words of Christ but as a customer, it’d be nice to be aware that not everyone wants their ears to be continuously hammered.

She always hands me the extension to partition when I’m already paying over £180 to get my hair done yet gets mad when I partition the hair too much, which leaves me feeling uncomfortable and awkward.

She also tried selling me a half used packet of extension, which is highly unprofessional because if that was anyone else, she wouldn’t have even felt comfortable doing that. Never again— wouldn’t recommend!",1,1752930384,6 months ago,en
ChIJceX_QylceUgRJ_BuC0nj6Ow,"Worst salon experience of my life!

Summary: I won’t advise anyone with 4C hair to go this salon. They didn’t handle my kinky hair with care and the salon owner got condescending and verbally abusive to me for opting to comb my hair myself.

Full story: I came to this salon today, 31 May 2025, to wash, steam and get crotchet faux locs done. I had rang prior and we agreed for £110 (£30 for a wash & steam, £80 for faux locs). The salon owner was all nice and lovely at first until I politely told her stylist she wasn’t detangling my hair properly - it was hurting so bad and half my hair was going to break off. Rather than asking how I’d like it done, she got offended and walked away.

I have 4C hair, you don’t just rack a comb through it. I happily opted to detangle and comb my hair myself then call the stylist when my hair was ready for the faux locs. The owner of the salon wasn’t happy that I was making them look incompetent by combing  my hair myself rather than sitting there and allowing them mess up natural hair.

She got angry and said to me, “You want us to comb your hair one by one (in sections). How much are you even paying? Since you know how to do hair, I should employ you in my salon. As a Christian, will you do all the work you’re asking for the amount you’re paying. Tell me, I’m talking to you.”

“All the work” she was referring to was to simply detangle and comb my hair with care, the proper way - something I was more than happy to do myself btw but ego is more important than professionalism.

Lol, truth is, I didn’t have an issue paying extra but she clearly didn’t have the right skills required to handled 4C hair. I paid her no mind and didn’t respond to any of her abusive comments cause there was no way I was getting in the mud with a grown woman who resorts to abusive words in public. She said a lot more in Twi which I didn’t understand too well.

Anyway, I ended up paying her for the wash & steam only and went to get my faux locs done professionally elsewhere in a lovely salon not too far off.",1,1748713866,8 months ago,en

ChIJ__-jbyNfeUgRaR8rM0GItxk,"Just had my nails done here for the first time, and personally, I wouldn't recomment. The staff far too informal. When I walked in, no greeting or a smile, just a brisk:"" have you got an appointment booked?"". They have a good banter on a far too casual, for my liking, level, including swearing slipping in here and there, while clients around. Like a bunch of trainees at the end of a full year training, where they know each other a tad too much, and are slowly getting bored of doing the job and being stuck together in one place.
My consultant, very lovely, but also somewhat inexperienced. Little pride for the work, little constructive criticism from colleagues, and when the attention to detail was lacking, and I pointed it out- she was genuinely surprised, and unaware. She couldn't see the issue. I suppose, when in Rome...-not a place for growth or development nor seeing good customer care in practice.
The job got done, reasonably well (one thumb nail didnt get cut, and disnt get stuck, it seems, as has come off when I got home) - edges still not buffed to even, in places bits missed out on the white, in places uneven white at the edge, to me, not enough attention to detail.... tried to take a couple of pic to show what I mean. The nails should be smooth and perfect.
I don't think I will be coming back, as ,try as I might, the environment and the stuffy room, made me rather uncomfortable. There was also a distinct smell in the room, nothing to do with the nails, more like a mix of damp and diy amonium hair dye, that felt rather intrusive after a short while, and you're there for over 1h.

ChIJdwVfQhtceUgRdExLERJ-vb8,"Taken me ages to write this as I hate to leave bad reviews but it was truly awful.
Most painful wax I've ever had.
Not sure if they use a different type of wax than I'm used to, but I was thinking of calling it off even at the calves, it was truly agonising.
I was terrified for my labia, felt like they were sustaining genuine harm.
If I had been raised to be more outspoken, I would have stopped the wax and just gone home. I kept thinking I need to stop this before she causes a serious issue, but I didn't dare speak up. I did mention a few times that it was a lot more pain than I was used to with other waxes, I guess that was my subtle way of seeing if she would offer to stop, but I should have been a lot more direct.
My intimate area was covered in swelling and bruising for days after, not ideal for a holiday.
It looked beaten up and abused.
I ended up getting folliculitis all over my bum cheeks and legs, had to rush and find a pharmacist who would sell me antibiotic ointment.
My hair was long but I did ask if I ought to shorten it to an appropriate length, was told no.
It's put me off getting waxed, I can't see myself daring to do it again.
I've never had an issue before, but I don't want to risk harming my body like this again.
Sorry to write a bad review but this cost me so much stress and worry, what with going away covered in infected folliculitis and bruises, and I just need to offer my perspective.
I did take photos but obviously can't add them due to the intimate nature, but trust, it was quite horrifying.
Also another thing I felt quite rushed and ended up with a different wax to the one I had intended on getting when I went in, which was a little disappointing but not the end of the world. I think she just presumed I wanted the most popular one.",1,1758070705,4 months ago,en

Was looking for a new salon for eyebrows, sadly Inches was not it. When I tried to explain what I wanted and liked, the owner (who was doing my eyebrows) talked all over me and didn't listen. When I asked for a mirror so I could explain, her response was ""I don't have a mirror"". I was trying to explain that I liked them to be straight rather than arched and was waiting for the hair to grow back. I also said I liked them thin at the ends. Her advice was not to go thin at the ends as it would thin them out (my eyebrows, so if I want them thin, that's my choice). It took a while for her to do them and then she lathered over some white stuff and asked me to take a look in the mirror in the reception area. Why you'd put your clients through the humiliation of looking at their lathered eyebrows in public view is beyond me. She had done exactly the opposite of what I asked....arched and thick at the end. She also started waxing areas of my chin without asking! Finally, she spent time telling me why hot wax was not good...I've been hot waxing my bikini area for 15+ years, and it works for me. It seems this is not a salon that is evolving with the times.

ChIJ36E-7TdZeUgRW6QOZ6NybRs,"Really annoyed! I've let some time pass before writing this review, hoping I'd think my hair wasn't so bad. But no. Haircut is the worst I've had in years. Been using this salon for an absolute age but have seen standards decline massively, but continued to go, because I had a favourite stylist who has now moved on.

Have never been a fan of Lisa salon owner. She's unpleasant, or artificially polite, and just makes me feel on edge. Bit of matriarch energy maybe? Just odd on the phone and in person. Not sure why she says 'yes with Lisa it's...' instead of saying 'with me...'

Had a different stylist on my last visit, and she's left my hair feeling like l let a 5 year old get happy with playing hairdresser! I'm a grown woman, so a bad haircut isn't as forgiving!

I get it! Everyone is stressed about the economy and life right now. But when you're wanting a pamper and paying steep prices, you want what you pay for!

I overlooked the entire experience on my last visit. From a shockingly dirty, yes dirty, and cluttered room where they wash hair, to a stylist that was insanely rushed when doing my hair (she must have knocked me at least 6 times!), and who was so zoned out, huffy puffy and fed up, I had to tell her a gazillion times what I wanted, and eventually gave up! She was clearly booked back to back which is always annoying! Doesn't make for a relaxing experience especially when your stylist is running around knocking you throughout! Oh and, my hair was washed before the stylist came to see my hair and ask what I wanted, which up until this visit, was standard protocol!

Just a God awful experience! Don't pay for a pamper to feel stressed. I left very stressed, wasn't particularly pleased with my haircut at the time, but couldn't wait to get out of there, won't be returning. No one wants a butchered look!

Sadly my time to see if I can find a new stylist!

Lastly, I thinks it's absolutely ridiculous that the price of a trim is the same as a cut and blow dry! And the price of a hair colour doesn't include hair drying?! Make it make sense!",1,1741534106,11 months ago,en

ChIJjzOHBSNceUgR7OZkh26q2gQ,"There is consistently a problem when collecting prescriptions from this pharmacy. The pharmacist is often on a lunch break or unavailable, and Linda is frequently left managing the counter on her own, visibly overwhelmed. Every time I visit, it feels like I am causing inconvenience just by showing up. On one occasion, Linda told me she was alone and busy and that I needed to come back later. I asked them once when would be a good time to come in in the future,  when they are fully staffed, but they were not able to answer.

I also have to double check my prescriptions, as not all items are given to me. Although the Crown Point location is convenient, the service here is the worst I have experienced when it comes to dispensing medication.

At my last visit, before handing over my prescription, I was asked if I take blood pressure medication. When I said no, I was still pushed to have a blood pressure check. I found this intrusive. It is not appropriate to question customers about their medication unless there is a clear clinical reason, and it should not be made to feel like a required step before dispensing.

She recommended a skin peel but due to knowing people in the industry, I knew that it is risky. I asked for the side effects and she stated the normal ones and said she she could do it for me. When I questioned her even more, I told her that I'm a skin type 4 and said I think it can damage my skin.

She then researched and confirmed that it could cause hyperpigmentation. The nurse then found out that she won't be able to do it due to the risk and a doctor would have to do it.

If I was a customer who didn't know anything about it, I would have booked in with her straight away thinking that there were no risks!

We were left in the dark for months waiting for a date, we were made to change from a sunday class to two 3 hour classes on a weekday evening which is NOT what we signed up for. I wasted 19 months of my life on a qualification that is absolutely no use. For example, the manicure section of the exam required us to do a manicure prep on only one hand but paint all 10 nails, all in 20 mins. What kind of skill does that even show? We were not allowed to wear any sort of nail polish/gel/biab/acrylics and my skin was absolutely ruined from the facials we had to do on each other every week, done with dirty equipment and instructed incorrectly. This was all dragged out over 19 months not to mention the near year’s worth of extra train journeys I paid for having to continue going in college after we were supposed to have finished the entire course. They’ve had 3 different managers while i was there and I was told this is all down to the booking team. I raised 3 separate complaints to the complaints department at the college and all i got was a ‘we apologise and we’ll do better for our future students’ email. The college is absolute mess and the emotional stress and the hold it has had on my life constantly weighing on me until i was able to finally finish the course has made me furious. Only 2 of us on my class finished the course this November. There is absolutely no accountability or acknowledgement from anyone. It’s appalling the money that has been spent on this course for the way we have been treated & I am so so disappointed in education systems getting away with this.",1,1734211453,a year ago,en

ChIJSXWqA8NbeUgRGJPscQ-07SQ,"Rebecca is not only one of the most professional people you will come across but has a lovely warming personality which straight away puts you at ease and fills you with confidence.

From my experience with previous services elsewhere, she goes above and beyond and I cannot fault her or her skills in anyway, shape or form!

Although it takes me around a 20/25 minutes drive to get to each appointment as I’m the opposite side of Leeds it is a billion percent worth it!

Fantastic service, price and results - I cannot say how impressed and delighted I am that I found her!

In short - she’s amazing and worth every single penny (in relation to what you get service and results wise, she’s very underpriced!)

————————

If you have time to carry on reading, or wanting an in depth review read below:

This was my second lash lift and tint with her, and can say I’m even happier with the results compared to the first time (which is a bold statement as they were perfect the first time)

Being a male & neurodivergent and booking in for a lash lift is not something I find easy nor comfortable normally however from day one dealing and speaking with Rebecca it was never an issue!

My first time with her I got the best results I ever had! Even though I have an issue with my eyes and forgot to mention this to her (water even when I lay down or on my side) she carried out the service impeccably and was incredibly patient and attentive to my watery eye - which again previous lash technicians haven’t been.

I also had the best results I’ve ever had from a lash lift and all credit to Rebecca.

My lashes never looked as good and as natural after a service! I found they also lasted well over 8 weeks - I have never received as many compliments about how beautiful, long my lashes are, or how lovely my eyes/eye colour is before either!

(Previous places made them look obvious, un-natural and results were limited to around 5/6 weeks max - not the case here)

I couldn’t be happier with everything from start to finish, and can certainly say you will be glad you chose her to provide the service you’re after!

So if you’re looking for an amazing new lash technician, in a fantastic clean professional environment then look no further! I also found it easy to park every time I have been to the salon

ChIJe_HBVhlceUgRY95Gv7rmoJE,"I was lucky enough to enjoy the synesthesia treatment with Katie at Lush Leeds Spa today - It was incredible!
I was really worried that it could be too overstimulating that I wouldn't be able to fully relax - I couldn't have been more wrong.
The massage was the perfect amount of pressure & Katie was wonderful, nothing was too much trouble and she was incredibly patient and understanding. She is very good at her job too - i actually cried a little during the massage, a sign that I was truly comfortable, relaxed and relieving a lot of built up tension.
I had never had a spa treatment before, so I was going in blind with what to expect - I think the bar might have been set quite high as I don't think a bog standard massage/spa treatment from just anywhere will do, Lush Leeds really exceeded my expectations today. The whole experience was immersive, relaxing and sensual for every single sense.
This treatment is expensive, but I can assure you, it is Worth. Every. Penny! I definitely recommend it, especially if you want something really special - a perfect gift for someone you love, that needs to relax and have some time for them!!

That said, the same space issue applies to the locker room and showers. They’re functional, but on the smaller side. Overall, it’s not ideal if you want a fully equipped gym, but works well if you value the pool and spa facilities.",4,1758119055,4 months ago,en

There had been young children from the age of 3 upwards in the jacuzzi from when we arrived (medically jacuzzi's aren't recommended for young under 5's) yet he chose to ignore this and pick on a young adult who was quite literally sitting there talking to his mum! Between that and the fact there are now two hours in the evening's that under 18's can't use the pool even with parental supervision, really gives the vibe that ageism is massively at play here and really they don't want children or young adults in there.

ChIJS2OzehxceUgR5lBgmE99O4A,"Nuffield Health Leeds – Not Worth the Premium Price

I’ve been a member for almost a year and unfortunately Nuffield Health leeds does not  reflect its premium pricing. Membership fees increased this month with no clear communication or explanation, and there have been no visible improvements to justify the rise.

The gym floor is very outdated: old flooring, poor layout, no proper accessibility, limited strength/functional equipment, and machines that are frequently broken or under repair. Maintenance is slow and reactive. Classes are often run on the gym floor, disrupting workouts, while dedicated studios sit empty.

The changing rooms and showers are particularly poor for a gym at this price point. Persistent bad smells from drains, dirty toilets, broken scales, loose panels, and showers with doors that don’t close properly, no locks, and little privacy. Cleaning feels reactive rather than routine, with issues lasting weeks.

The spa and pool area has potential but is underwhelming: the steam room smells unpleasant, noise travels easily into relaxation areas, seating is limited, and lighting is harsh.

Importantly, the staff are excellent — consistently friendly, kind, and helpful. This is not a staff issue, but one of investment, maintenance, and management priorities.

Many cheaper gyms in Leeds offer newer equipment, cleaner facilities, and better layouts. Until meaningful upgrades are made — including improving the overall aesthetic and environment — Nuffield Health Leeds does not offer value that matches its price or brand.",1,1767686162,a month ago,en

I'm not sure the dressing gown I was offered had been washed since the last customer which was a bit worrying. The smell of the place was quite distinctive. Two big lads showed up and loudly proclaimed which of the female masseuses 'they would take' (I could hear them through the door and when I exited it was clear that they weren't zen seekers).

The therapist clearly knew what she was doing, very skilled, focused on the areas I asked for, and explained everything in terms of Chinese medical treatment, which I appreciated.

However, the experience overall just felt weird. First, the room wasn’t heated, and since I was only having a back, shoulder, and neck massage, my lower body wasn’t covered or kept warm at all. I was actually a bit cold throughout and there was no soothing music played.

But the strangest and most uncomfortable part was that the therapist didn’t leave the room while I was changing — not before or after the massage. She just stayed there the whole time as I took my clothes off and put them back on. Personally, I’m not very body-conscious, so it didn’t bother me too much, but it did feel very unprofessional and left me wondering if that’s their normal practice with everyone… or if she didn’t trust me for some reason (which made me uncomfortable).

ChIJN-HWbgBdeUgR1quiSh1tDjU,"Paid £80 upfront for a 60-minute full body Thai massage for my partner, after clearly explaining that his shoulders needed particular attention.

He is not the type to complain, but the experience was poor enough that I went back myself to question it.

What he actually received was around 40 minutes of pressure over a towel, followed by about 20 minutes of light stroking on his neck, despite repeatedly asking for shoulder work. She briefly used an elbow on only his left calf with no work on the right side at all, showing a lack of balance or technique. No oil was used on his legs or lower back, and the front of his arms and legs were completely ignored, despite this being sold as a full body massage.

There was no background music, the main light was left fully on, and no effort was made to create a relaxing or professional environment.

The person carrying out the massage appeared to be the receptionist rather than a trained therapist. She wore jeans and an oversized jumper and stood in the room while he undressed and dressed, which was extremely uncomfortable and unprofessional. He is also fairly certain she was using her phone during parts of the massage itself.

When I questioned what we had paid for, I explained that I am trained in Swedish massage and that both of us have had many genuine Thai massages. What was provided was not a Thai massage at all. She then admitted they are not Thai therapists, despite selling the treatment as a Thai massage, and simply kept repeating “next time” instead of addressing the issue.

ChIJSTzJC01deUgRvTzL3wGEZXA,"I had a very disappointing experience at the Leeds branch.

I was refused treatment in a way that felt discriminatory, as the explanation focused on my ethnicity rather than an individual skin assessment.

I have a light skin tone (equivalent to Fitzpatrick Type II), and the same type of laser equipment is commonly used in clinics in South Korea for people with similar skin tones. Despite this, my appointment was cancelled.

When I suggested a patch test as a reasonable way to address any safety concerns, this option was not offered or accepted, and no alternative assessment was provided.

As a result, my time and expenses were wasted, and I left feeling unfairly treated. I hope the clinic reviews how suitability is assessed and ensures customers are evaluated individually and professionally, without assumptions.

Photo caption :
Attached photo shows my natural skin tone for reference.

Update:
For clarity, no clinical test, device-based assessment, or patch test was performed prior to my skin being labelled as Fitzpatrick III.
During the recorded telephone call, I was told that Korean clients are classified as Type III without testing, and in person my skin type was determined based on appearance alone.
I have written manufacturer guidance from Candela confirming that ethnicity is not a contraindication, that Fitzpatrick II–III are approved, and that patch testing is recommended where there is uncertainty.

When I first joined the clinic, I specifically asked about expiration, and I was told that I could still use the sessions even after one year. In fact, I did use sessions after one year before, so I was very surprised to hear that the rules had changed, or that I was given incorrect information.

At no point was I informed that the sessions would expire, and I did not receive any reminder or notification about an expiration date. If the policy has changed, customers should be clearly informed.

ChIJI35N4ZRdeUgREvjj2Y17Ppk,"This was such an amazing massage and I've had so many!! I was in Leeds for the first time and had booked a 90 minute deep tissue massage. I thought it would be back, neck and shoulders but it was full body and it was just incredible. She also clicked my back at the end after putting me into all sorts of positions. She could tell/feel I had a bad shoulder and before I came here I was taking codeine every day for the pain. I visited 3 or 4 weeks ago now and I still haven't had to take pain killers since. I literally left feeling brand new and genuinely wish I lived in Leeds purely to come here all the time!! Whenever I come back, I will a million percent be coming back here! The ladies were so friendly and lovely too!!
It was a little hard to find, you have to walk into the supermarket and walk up the stairs at the back to get there. I phoned them to say I couldn't find it and they helped me on the phone.

The therapist is very strong and doesn't shy away from putting pressure on problem areas. This can cause pain/discomfort but if you are experienced then you know this is normal. If it's too much, say and they will stop. I think it's great value for money given over the road at Nuad Thai Boran you pay £20 more for the same thing.

I recently visited this spa and had the pleasure of experiencing floating therapy for the first time in my life, followed by a relaxing massage with Natasha. Floating therapy was absolutely mind-blowing—it was one of the best experiences of my life!

The massage was equally incredible. Natasha was highly professional, attentive, and truly poured her heart into every moment of the treatment. It was deeply relaxing and exactly what I needed.

Malaika welcomed me and introduced me to the floating therapy with such outstanding service that I immediately felt at home. She was incredibly kind and professional, and at the end of my visit, she surprised me with a lovely Christmas bracelet and a sweet treat—it was such a great gesture!

ChIJ1yPlT4ldeUgRDh0mYNDYx_8,"i’ve been going to zara for my lip filler since moving to leeds, today was the 4th time, and honestly i wouldn’t trust anyone else. i only go back every 2 years because my filler holds so well, which says everything. this time was my second 0.5ml and she’s absolutely perfected my lip shape, she never overdoes it, just tops them up to look natural and perfect.

what i love most is that i completely trust her judgment! she would never give me more than i need (she’d never push 1ml if 0.5ml is enough). zara is so knowledgeable and reassuring, and both her and her sister estelle are genuinely the loveliest.

the clinic has such a warm, energetic, welcoming vibe it’s such a nice place to be. i love my lips every single time, and my girlfriend has booked in with them now too. couldn’t recommend them enough !!!",5,1766872103,a month ago,en
ChIJ1yPlT4ldeUgRDh0mYNDYx_8,"there is truly nobody i would trust more than zara with anything on my face. time and time again i’ve gone to her thinking I wanted one thing only for her to suggest something completely different and every single time what she recommends works a million times better (obviously🤣) . her knowledge, perfectionism and skill are genuinely incredible, she has such an unbelievable talent

everything zara does is carried out with such care, precision and expertise. she understands faces on a level that is SO reassuring and she is completely honest, she will happily say no if she doesn’t believe something will look right for you. that alone speaks volumes about her professionalism and integrity. she listens to exactly what it is you want to change, takes the time to really understand your insecurities and problem areas, and then does everything in her power to make sure you leave feeling your absolute best inside and out

i went in wanting tear trough treatment, something id wanted for such a long time as I’d always had deep lines under my eyes that were a huge insecurity for me. instantly zara told me that tear trough wasn’t what I needed and wasn’t right for me and suggested an alternative. trusting that advice was so daunting especially when you have your heart so set on something you THINK will work for you but the results were so much better than i could ever have imagined and i am so overwhelmed by how much better i feel, i genuinely don’t know why i doubted her for a single second. this is just one example of how perfectly she understands what your face truly needs. she applies the same level of precision and care to everything she does, my lips and botox are always so beyond perfect and exactly right for my face and something i get complimented on soooo often (even after not having them done for 4 years because they lasted so well). she has never let me down and honestly knows my face wayyyyy better than i do

beyond her talent, zara is one of the most beautifully kind, purest people you could ever meet. i genuinely look forward to my appointments just to see her, even more than for the treatments themselves. she will always squeeze me in for last minute appointments where she can, she is always asking about me and my life but honestly the entire team at the clinic are just as wonderful. everybody is so warm, welcoming and attentive. they remember all  the little details, always take the time to chat with you, and consistently make sure you feel comfortable and cared for

i honestly couldn’t recommend this clinic more and would talk about it until i was blue in the face if i could. zara has built something truly special and hearing how much her business continues to grow at each appointment makes me so happy because you really see and feel all of the hard work she puts in and there is absolutely nobody more deserving. if you’re ever unsure where to go for aesthetics, there is absolutely no question that this is the place. truly the best in the game 🥺🤍",5,1766534747,a month ago,en

Let’s start with the reception, we have been asked whether this is our first visit to which we have confirmed. We have expected an explanation how everything works here, as we also had towels and robe rental. The email confirmation stated that flip flops will be provided, however, they have ran out those and have not made any effort to explain until we came back to ask for it, yet we have been charged £10 for the towel, bag, robe and flip flops. The receptionist simply guided to upstairs to say where the spa procedures are but there are no clear indications where the spa treatments rooms are, as the sign above the door states different information. When we walked into the ‘spa salon’, ladies working there didn’t bother to greet us, and only a third lady (who we believe is a spa manager said Hello and someone will be with you shortly). Hubby enjoyed the massage, but not me. The lady doing the massage seemed very pleasant though.
The pool is overcrowded allowing people to play using toys that are not suitable for pool. There are fast and medium lines that are quite wide and runs through the pool, but the slow lane ir short and overcrowded - difficult to swim. Showers in the pool area are close to non running. Jacuzzi is cold, not temperature it should be. The families we chatted with also confirmed the same. The changing rooms are cold too - aircon is blasting - should be kept warmer. We have not been shown where to drop off dirty towels and robes, I stood in the reception for few minutes listening to three members simply sipping their coffees and chatting rather than helping me out, whilst the receptionist was on the phone. When I noticed where the drop of point is, and made a comment the receptionist didn’t bother to acknowledge or speak to me (she was off the phone by that time).

The place itself looks quite thrown together and the facilities were quite run down and scruffy considering the location and prices they charge. The customer toilet door didn’t close so I had to wee with the door open, which felt a bit weird and unprofessional. There was no proper loo roll so I had to use hand tissues that had been put in there, and I wasn't offered a glass of water so had to ask for one. I know it's only a small thing but most places will offer you one when you arrive. Nothing about the treatment was explained to me beforehand, I wasn't  asked about any health conditions or injuries and it all felt quite rushed. The massage itself was really lovely and I actually fell asleep during because I was so tired. However the masseuse had really cold hands to start with, which was a bit of a shock initially, and I would definitely consider the oils she used to be far too strong for use on the face and head area.

I asked for some layers and she cut the front half of my head short and the back hair left it long, untouched. I  have spent week's crying about it as there is not fix but to wait it grow out which can take years.
She also made me feel extremely uncomfortable during the cut as she kept fake smiling at her other members of staff and not paying attention to the cut.
I wanted to finish my haircut with some curls and she was not in the mood so I ended up without any style at the end.
I rescheduled an appointment to fix the cut but then decided not to in the end as I'm too scared to destroy the little hair I got left. Will never go to glitch again..such unprofessional service as well.
I have attached photo of the haircut in question so you can see how bad it looks.

Update: the salon just called me, harassing me over the review I left, calling me a liar. I was trying to speak to explain exactly what happened but he kept yelling at me over the phone twisting my words around so be mindful, they will harass you over the phone if you leave a a genuine bad review.
If he would’ve called me and asked about my experience and being understanding of my feelings instead of yelling at me over the phone, calling me a liar there was a chance of me removing this review.

From the moment I walked in, the whole experience felt professional, welcoming, and completely personalised. The consultation was thorough, and everything was explained clearly, which instantly made me feel confident I was in safe hands. Kate explained all the proces carefully as well so I was prepared what the upkeep will be.

The tapes themselves are incredible, super lightweight, discreet, and perfectly blended with my natural hair. They feel so comfortable that I genuinely forget I’m wearing extensions, and the finish is flawless. The colour match is spot on, and the hair quality is amazing, soft, glossy, and easy to style. This is my second set and we have gone for european hair this time which blends in so well with my fine har

What really stands out is the attention to detail and care. The application was quick and precise, with no pulling or discomfort at all. I’ve had tape extensions before elsewhere, but these are by far the best I’ve ever had, they sit flat, don’t show, and still look fresh weeks later.

We cannot thank Becky enough for the incredible care and expertise she provided at the salon. My husband had been struggling with multiple skin tags for quite some time, and they had become a source of discomfort and a knock to his confidence. From the very first consultation, Becky was warm, professional, and reassuring.

The treatment took several visits due to the number of skin tags, but each session was handled with such care and precision. Becky made sure my husband was comfortable throughout the process, explaining everything in detail and tailoring the approach to suit his skin. Her attention to hygiene, her gentle manner, and her genuine passion for helping people shine through in everything she does.

Now, with the skin tags gone, my husband feels like a new man. It's been truly life-changing – not just in appearance, but in confidence and overall happiness.

I was trying to collect my parcel in the store and when I walked in this boots the staffs are having arguments, so I was waiting patiently and then they came to me and ask for my name. I was waiting to show my parcel number, so I tried to check my user name immediately on my phone. Suddenly the staff yelled at me, she said, Look at me!

I was really shocked and I am scared, I wonder why she speak in a rude tone with me because I did nothing wrong, I behave well and I have a slight smile on my face. Is that because I am a little Asian girl? So I look easy to bully, they don't need to pay anything so they can yell at me and ordered me to 'Look at them' with no respect. I almost cry and I feel panic, but I can do nothing because I am just a foreigner living alone in this area and they yell at me to let me look at them, I thought maybe it's just some strange social rules in UK, but after I ask my local friend, they say no, they are just being rude and trying to bully me. Say I'm checking my information on my phone, even if I'm really too shy to look at this lady, what did I do wrong?

I hope the manager in this store could take care of their staff and check if everything's all right, make sure they are not under pressure or have any severe issues with their body or brain. Try to be as a civilized human being please, don't yell at a customer.",1,1701799386,2 years ago,en

It's really unkind and unnecessary to be spoken to by somebody older than you in that way especially when you are just asking for guidance.

I wrote a complaint to the head of the salon and asked for a full refund because I was served by a person with little experience without being informed about it in advance 😧

Unfortunately, this solution does not suit me because they have already abused my trust and I am going on vacation.

I asked for a full refund again and got the answer that I can only get a refund for my hands because the feet are made well, which is completely absurd.

ChIJ4UkRFemNcUgR3kZIexVEvsI,"The therapist was late letting me in for an evening myofascial massage, leaving me waiting outside. Rather than offer an apology, she complained about having to juggle evening clients alone. She then spent 15 minutes describing therapies I hadn’t requested—such as cupping and dry needling. By this point, we were 20 minutes into a paid treatment. I was then asked to do a ‘gait analysis’, which I declined.
If an extended consultation is required, the appointment should be booked accordingly—either longer, or clearly explained in advance. It shouldn’t eat into the treatment itself.

She proceeded to ask me to remove my shorts while standing right next to me, without offering any privacy. During the massage, she was rough with a knee injury we had just discussed. When I raised this, she offered to end the session—leaving no real option. When I asked for a refund, she refused, left the room agitated, then returned and told me she would “make sure I never came back again.”

I reported this to Nicola Dimmer, who not only defended the therapist, but failed to even acknowledge: the unapologetic lateness; lack of privacy; the aggravation of an existing injury; the refusal to refund a session the therapist had offered to terminate after causing me pain; or – the open threat made to a longstanding client (with good relationships with other therapists).

I've been growing my hair for many months now and she cut the top layers & fringe which I had explained that I didn't want. She seemed to not pay any attention when I tried to discuss my cut saying ""we would talk about the cut once the colour was on"". I felt she thought she knew what I wanted so didn't bother to ask any further. I'm now left with the (many months) of hair growth gone, which is extremely annoying.

ChIJw1Y8K8WNcUgRSsXQZ8JM7Go,"My partner and I have been members here since August 2025, and honestly, I can't imagine training anywhere else in Bristol now. We initially prioritized Nuffield for the wet facilities–the 20m pool, sauna, and steam room are excellent–but the variety of the gym floor and group classes has kept us hooked. From Body Pump to Pilates, the quality of instruction in the two studios is consistently top-tier.

The staff are genuinely friendly and the complimentary towel service is a brilliant touch that makes the experience feel much smoother. However, to give a complete picture: the facility is showing its age slightly. The lockers are on the smaller side, and you won't find a hyper-modern or ""fancy"" aesthetic here. It feels like a standard, established UK club rather than a futuristic luxury spa–which is fairly typical and perfectly acceptable, but worth noting if you are expecting brand-new fittings.

The pool does get busy during peak hours (after work and weekends), but with a little patience, it is always manageable. The membership is at a premium price point, but if you are consistent with your routine, it is hands down the best investment you can make for yourself.",5,1769899513,in the last week,en
ChIJw1Y8K8WNcUgRSsXQZ8JM7Go,"I am glad I have now cancelled my membership and I am writing this to warn others about the declining standards at Nuffield Health. Despite recent price increases, there is no planned investment in the facilities. The environment has become a genuine health and safety concern.
The condensation in the changing rooms is dangerous. Steam is not being properly extracted, leading to saturated floors and visible mould a clear breach of Regulation 6 and Regulation 12 of the Workplace Regulations 1992. Asking members to pay more while allowing the building to fall into this state is unacceptable.
To make matters worse, I requested a copy of my signed contract to review my rights. The staff were unable to find it and one staff member I dealt with clearly has not been trained in customer service and used a very argumentative manner in response to my questioning on how they can not find a copy I must remind management that under the Data Protection Act 2018 (UK GDPR), they have a legal obligation to provide a copy of my personal data including my signed agreement within 30 days of a request. It’s also worth noting that the same member of staff has been leaving 5 star reviews for the gym to cover over negative reviews!
It is bold to increase fees while failing to provide a safe environment or basic administrative transparency. I plan to formally report these ventilation and safety issues to the Local council Environmental Health Department for inspection. I strongly suggest management prioritises repairs over profit before an injury occurs. And as for the majority of the staff they are all great and very helpful!! And I appreciate these issues can’t be solved by themselves more the powers above!",1,1768155195,3 weeks ago,en
ChIJw1Y8K8WNcUgRSsXQZ8JM7Go,"I’ve been a member of Nuffield Clifton on and off for over 15 years. Unfortunately, it’s clear that the facility has not seen meaningful maintenance or upgrades during that time, despite consistent and significant membership price increases. It now appears the cost of membership is around £115 a month – pricing that suggests a premium experience, but the reality is far from that.

Facilities and Cleanliness:
The gym feels outdated and poorly maintained. The swimming pool water often looks murky and gives off an odd smell. While it seems a “cleaning team” has been introduced in response to negative reviews, their efforts don’t appear thorough. Surfaces might get wiped down, but deeper cleaning is clearly being neglected.

The changing rooms are especially disappointing. Dirty, wet towels are often left lying around. The cover sheets in changing rooms are visibly caked in muck, makeup, and grime. Showers frequently contain hair, plasters, and general residue. Lockers are outdated and could benefit from a full refurbishment.

The cleanliness of the shower area continues to be a concern. There is frequently visible hair in the drains and on the floors, suggesting that these areas are not being adequately cleaned or checked throughout the day. The showers themselves appear old and rusted, with grime accumulating around the fittings, making them look neglected and unhygienic.

In the changing rooms, the sheet pullovers used on benches are often stained with make-up, dirt, and general grime, which is not only off-putting but raises concerns about sanitation standards. Small but noticeable issues such as paint peeling near the hand dryers and a faulty shower cubicle door — which is almost coming off.

Classes and Studios:
Pilates and other studio spaces are also poorly managed. One of the Pilates rooms currently contains building equipment scattered across the floor. In a recent class, there was even a pot noodle left in the corner – not quite the calm, clean environment you’d expect from a health and wellbeing venue.

Gym Equipment and Amenities:
Many machines do not support Bluetooth connectivity, and screens that used to play Sky Sports have been removed. This removes a once-popular feature that added to the gym experience.

Suggested Improvements:
•	Clean the changing rooms regularly and thoroughly – not surface wipes, but a full, scheduled clean with accountability.
•	Swimming pool loungers – invest in heated ones like other clubs offer.
•	Sports access on gym screens – reinstate Sky Sports or a similar subscription for gymgoers.
•	Steam room – update it fully, not just patch repairs.
•	Make the cleaning team effective – provide training or oversight to ensure the job is done properly.
•	Locker replacement – update the lockers to provide a more modern, functional experience.
•	General maintenance – ensure studio spaces are free from construction gear or leftover food.
•	Transparency on pricing – if fees increase, members deserve to see tangible improvements.",2,1753998352,6 months ago,en
ChIJw1Y8K8WNcUgRSsXQZ8JM7Go,"I've been a member at Nuffield Clifton for about 3 years.  The gym facilities are good, as are the pool, sauna and steam room, though the changing rooms & showers could do with a little tlc.  However, the gym's best asset is their Fitness Manager, Jessica.  I began PT sessions with her earlier this year and she's honestly the reason I keep my membership going. If you're looking for an experienced & knowledgeable PT that really listens to your goals, demonstrates & explains exercises well, pushes you just the right amount whilst understanding your limitations, regularly varies & tailors your routines and is also really nice with it, then I can't recommend her highly enough.",5,1761766180,3 months ago,en

Unfortunately, the changing rooms and lockers are way past their best and in other areas the decor is worn, with wiring left exposed. Repairs also appear to have been abandoned, with errant ladders lying about. I suspect the facility hasn’t been given much care since at least 2011, accounting for its deterioration.

ChIJo88FgsSNcUgRZnmgMEkKsSw,"I have wanted to visit here for soooo long! Finally got the perfect excuse and brought my best friend for her birthday. We were greeted at reception and given a quick tour of the facilities. We were given a robe and a towel each and we changed into these before going up to the massage waiting room. We were collected by our massage therapists and taken into our own private rooms for the massage. The treatment was lovely and the hour passed by way too quickly! We then were taken to a relaxation are and made a cup of tea which was lovely after the massage.

I would like to offer a pro tip at this point, there was an autumnal nip in the air and we hadn't remembered to take flipflops but the floor was super chilly on the toes! If you feel the cold like I do, remember your sandals or flipflops!

After we had booked time to use the pool and facilities. We had the best time popping between the sauna, pool, hot tub, and steam room. It was never too busy in any of the areas and they were all clean. We were incredibly fortunate with the weather and it literally felt like we had gone on holiday for the day!

We hadn't booked in for lunch but the smells coming from the kitchen were making us both hungry so we asked if they took walk ins at the spa reception and the lady said yes. We popped through a little door and were in the restaurant and were seated at a lovely table in 10 mins. Our waitress was lovely and we ordered some of the small plates and some lovely refreshing drinks. The food came out relatively quickly considering how busy it was (it was peak lunch time 1.30pm) and was well presented and oh so delicious! I don't often eat out so to me the food was amazing! The tapas style food we picked was so flavourful and the perfect amount for sharing. We were recommended a delicious pudding and enjoyed every mouthful!

Minia is extremely knowledgeable around anatomy, considers all aspects that may be contributing to pain such as old injury, lifestyle, stress levels, so takes a holistic approach to treatment.

Minia's hands are like liquid gold. She managed to deliver wonderful deep pressure in a beautifully slow and controlled way. I literally felt I was melting. On addressing my hip, she was checking in with me to understand my pain levels and adjusting the pressure to ensure this was at a manageable level and to release any stuck tension. This was really specific work and was super helpful for me to reconnect with what was going on.

The deadlift platform downstairs is absolutely not fit for purpose, being severely slanted. I put my back out doing deadlifts a on it and subsequently don't use it at all. You are not allowed to deadlift upstairs where the floor is slightly less wonky so there is nowhere to do heavy weights that keeps your back safe.
The gym is really busy and it's hard to find space to work if you go after work and sometimes in the daytime too.
There is also black mould growing on the windows in the cardio room- not good for anyone with respiratory problems.

That’s 13 kg down — and it wouldn’t have been possible without his consistent support and expertise.

Kyle is a true subject matter expert in fitness. He not only understands the science behind workouts and nutrition but also knows how to tailor training programs to individual needs. Every session with him was challenging, well-planned, and focused on results.

What I appreciate most is how he pushed me to go beyond my limits while always ensuring proper form and safety. His no-nonsense yet encouraging approach kept me accountable and motivated throughout the journey.

If you're serious about getting fit and want someone who truly knows what they're doing, Kyle is the trainer you want by your side.",5,1749920550,7 months ago,en

From the moment you walk through the door, you're greeted with his warm smile and positive attitude, setting the tone for a productive workout. His impressive physique and qualifications speak volumes, but what truly sets him apart is the genuine care and attention he gives to each of his clients. Kyle takes the time to understand your goals and tailors his approach to support you every step of the way. Whether you're just starting out or you've been training for years, I couldn't recommend Kyle more highly for anyone seeking expert guidance and real results on their health and fitness journey.",5,1750149027,7 months ago,en

My knee issues significantly improved, my complexion returned to normal, and I was able to fit into my old trousers again. Most importantly, my confidence soared.
If you're looking to transform your body, I highly recommend this gym. Kyle is incredibly knowledgeable and supportive. His expertise in both fitness and nutrition genuinely surprised me, and his guidance has made a lasting impact on my health and well being. 😊😊😊",5,1750168681,7 months ago,en

I had a hard time gaining weight and didn’t enjoy the gym that much due to being unsure of what to do or how to train effectively. From our very first session, Kyle not only taught me proper technique but also how to push my body to its limits to start seeing real results.

He’s always friendly, supportive, and consistently gives valuable feedback—both in the gym and when it comes to nutrition. Thanks to his support, a year later I’ve gone from 60kg to 87kg, and most of that is lean muscle.

Kyle is also a great nutritionist. He listened to my feedback and regularly adapted my meal plans to make sure I was bulking or cutting properly, depending on my goals.

I enjoy every session. Kyle constantly switches things up and introduces new exercises to keep the workouts intense. Now, I can confidently smash out a solo intensive gym session and see the gains.",5,1744579864,9 months ago,en

This is my first time visiting. The general vibe wasn’t welcoming, when I entered nobody acknowledged my presence until I managed to get the attention of the lady at the front desk and was then told to follow someone upstairs. When I entered the room the bed had a dirty paper towel on it from the previous client which wasn’t a good first impression. A new paper was laid out and I was left to change and lay on the bed. There was no additional cover provided for me, no conversation of what areas I want to be waxed and she didn’t even tell me her name. The procedure was very messy, I was left with wax dribbled over me from when wax was picked up from the pot. It was overall a really uncomfortable service. For other areas I was told it’s my fault my hair growth is so bad because I have shaved, even though I have been a regular waxer for 8 years. At certain points in the appointment she was audibly huffing and sighing which felt extremely rude. There was very little conversation throughout the whole thing which made me feel quite uncomfortable. The final straw was when I turned over near the end to notice she was using the same spatula to dip back into the waxing pot which is extremely unhygienic and a serious health hazard. I’ve paid for many professional waxes and this was just not up to standard.",1,1761691578,3 months ago,en

We went into the massage room and my masseuse put music on coming directly from her phone, which already seemed to lack some professionalism. Later, during the message, she got a call, which interrupted the music and then turned into a loud Youtube advert.

My masseuse chatted to me for the first twenty minutes of the massage, which was nice in a way, but also a bit distracting when I just wanted to relax. I also had a hard time understanding her as she had a thick accent, and I felt the need to concentrate to decipher what she was saying.

Worst of all, we finished over twenty minutes early. I had checked my watch before we started just in case. I had to fight my case with her when we were done. She said that her manager had seen when I came in on camera and that I had gone to the toilet, as if some kind of timer had started the moment I walked in.

Unfortunately was left coming away darker than before and when I tried to speak to Maisie about this, she didn’t reply to my messages for days and when she did recommended another colour was needed (another £130), which I made clear in the first appointment I didn’t have hundreds to spend at once. The last message I sent still hasn’t been replied too over a week and a half later. Really upset with the treatment and service provided, and now have booked in with a previous salon to fix it. I’ve never had this issue before with hairdressers and absolutely hate complaining but when paying £130 to colour my hair and not have it at all how I asked I feel I have been cheated a little.

If you’re okay with a manicure that looks like the pictures, that’s your choice - but it’s not just unprofessional, it’s downright terrible. I went to Tania.

PS. I just noticed another hole on the surface of my ring finger nail. Two deep holes in total. I’m honestly in shock. My friends are, too. Tania was literally drilling my cuticle at the expense of my nail. What she offered is to cover it with the nail polish.
PSS - what’s Tania has done - she removed cuticles with the electric cuticle drill bit together with the top surface of my nails. It really hurts now all day long as if I had a bad dental pain but in my nails, and they are thin and bendy. Shocking service.

I advanced paid £20.95 each for 2 pedicures (£42) through Groupon, but when I arrived found my appointment slots had been cancelled out. She said she did not make any money on the Groupon appointments and had given our slots to regular customers who pay her more. She refused to find another appointment slot for me and said it was Groupon's fault and basically pushed us out the door. The rudest salon experience I have ever had by a long shot. It seems she uses Groupon to fill in empty slots and feels justified to cancel and not make restitution because she says 'most the profit goes to Groupon, and I give appointments to my regulars first"" -- clearly she resented how little she gets paid. As the owner of the business, it did not make sense to me why she sabotaged our goodwill by refusing to honour our pre-paid appointments, blaming Groupon. Exercise caution using this salon, because if she cancels on you,  you as customer have to do all the administration (taking nearly two hours with Groupon so far and as yet unresolved), then having to  contact credit card company to get the charges removed. An utter disaster for us -- ruined our morning. I'm remain out £41.90 because of her dispute with Groupon -- we did nothing wrong but it is us that has to fight to get our money back. [update: in the end, if you PHONE Groupon, then you get good service - do not use email. The customer service rep promptly refunded me my money.]",1,1554225338,6 years ago,en
ChIJgepda0mFdUgRGXxAxB3LtwA,"I bought a Groupon for a pedicure for my mum and the only availability they had was Tuesday daytime. She called up as soon as she got the voucher and after multiple attempts of trying to get through by phone call, they just said they’d only be able to fit her in on a Tuesday daytime. She works all day on Tuesdays, but does have Thursday to Sunday’s off. She asked whether any of those days were free at any time and they said no.

Today (Thursday afternoon), we decided to go into the salon to see if she could book. One staff member  was sat down in the empty salon of Natural Beauty, Church Road, Hove. When my mum tried the door, she found the door was locked and the lady l seemed reluctant to open it. When the lady finally opened the door, she stood at the door, blocking the entrance and didn’t invite my mum in. My mum explained that she’d like to book this pedicure in which the woman replied it was only Tuesday daytime she could book for this deal. The salon was empty so my mum asked whether she could have it now, in which the woman replied no? By this point, my mum said she wasn’t happy and that she was going to contact Groupon, to which the woman replied ‘okay’. The woman who worked there basically did not care at all. I’m not sure why she was sat in the salon, with the door locked and no customers and yet the opening times stated they were currently open. It’s the worst way to run a business and an absolute embarrassment that Groupon would be associated with such a joke of business.

Just to also add no where on the Groupon offer did it state that there was only availability for booking this on a Tuesday otherwise I would have not booked it for my mum as I know she works.

I would avoid at all costs. They don’t care and to only think that they’re like this before your treatment, goodness knows what they’d be like during your treatment.",1,1568300158,6 years ago,en
ChIJgepda0mFdUgRGXxAxB3LtwA,Came here on a Groupon. Not worth the money I paid. Salon messy and not very clean. Would not recommend. She didn't do the pedicure as I asked either so a fail all round. Seeking a refund from Groupon.,1,1556086425,6 years ago,en
ChIJgepda0mFdUgRGXxAxB3LtwA,"Really liked the Tanino hair therapy.  I got the straightening hair treatment that contained no formol! I love that because when I used to get a keratin treatment there was formol in the products, it damaged my hair and the fumes would burn my eyes whilst getting it done. The  products luzinete has is does quite the opposite, highly recommend.",5,1556026092,6 years ago,en
